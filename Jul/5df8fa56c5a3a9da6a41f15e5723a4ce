Not less than 22 persons were reportedly killed while scores of women were abducted when suspected bandits attacked Zangon-Kankara and Makera in Kankara Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State. A resident of Zango-Kankara disclosed that the attacks occurred on Thursday evening. He said while 18 people were killed in Zangon, four lost their lives in Makera where several women were abducted. The resident said the attackers had written letters to the villagers ahead of the attack, warning them that they would strike. “The bandits had attacked Zangon earlier on Sunday and they came back on Thursday around 8p.m. They wrote letters to the village that they were coming to attack but nothing was done. Several people were killed in the attack, while many of our women were abducted,” he said. “Our people fled the town when the bandits attacked them. Police came nine hours later. Even with the presence of security operatives in the villages as we speak, people are leaving in droves.” Efforts to reach the police spokesman, Gambo Isah, were furtile.
