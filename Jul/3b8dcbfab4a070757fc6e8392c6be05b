Our attention has been drawn to the lead story published in the VANGUARD Newspaper of Monday July 29, 2019, with the headline: “Edo Assembly crisis: Buhari directs Obaseki to issue fresh proclamation – el-Rufai.” We wish to state categorically that the story is false as there is no Presidential directive to the Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, to issue a fresh proclamation. President Muhammadu Buhari that we know is a law-abiding leader who will not issue directives that contradict the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution. The Nigerian Constitution 1999 as amended, mandates state governors to issue proclamation only once for the inauguration of their Houses of Assembly and the Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has dutifully performed this function. The publication is one of the many efforts by agents and hirelings sponsored by entrenched interests in the state whose stranglehold on the state’s resources has been displaced by the people-centric governance model of the Obaseki-led administration. We urge the public and all concerned to disregard the publication. Crusoe Osagie Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy to Edo State Governor.
