Goddy Egene As prices of shares continue to dip at the stock with some hitting two-year low, the Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON) has cautioned investors against panic sale of their securities, to avert losses. The association insisted that the stock market would soon rebound. The local bourse booked another decline for the third consecutive week as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index fell 2.27 per cent to close at 27,919.50, while market capitalisation ended at N13.922 trillion.  The market had depreciated by 2.41 per cent the previous week. However, while some nervous and short term investors may be contemplating selling to exit the market due to the persistent bearish run, the Chairman of ASHON, Chief Patrick Ezeagu, has advised against panic sale of shares, saying the negative trend would soon be reversed. The ASHON boss noted that two investors may not necessarily have the same motive for sale or buy order, saying this is where the need for professional investment advice from stockbrokers become compelling. He stated that a trend analysis of corporate earnings in recent time indicates that many companies across sectors have posted higher earnings with good returns but this has not significantly reflected in the upward movement of their share prices. Ezeagu explained that there was nothing unusual about this as the market generally reflects the trend in the economy, hence, investors buy into the future of these companies on the expectation of higher shareholder value.  He said: “Those who are selling off their shares right now are speculators and not real investors. Every stock market needs speculators for liquidity but they can change investment decision in one second. Our stock market is forward looking. Investors need not be nervous. “They should consult professional stockbrokers for sound investment decision. There is no basis for panic sale of shares. Many companies have announced strong financial performance with prospects of increased future earnings. Why should a shareholder of such a company embark on panic sale of shares? “Globally, stock market gauges the mood of the economy like a barometer. Our market is not a local one. Foreign investors have significant stakes because their analysis has always convinced them that our market has potential for strong Return on Investment (ROI). “At the moment, core investors are awaiting a couple of things, including announcement of ministers of the Federal Republic and the Economic Team to show the clear direction of the government. “These are issues that are beyond the council and  management of  the NSE but have dire consequences on investment decisions. The bearish trend has to do with the fact that the government is yet to settle down after the elections. However, astute and professionally guided investors should take position now that most stocks are trading lower than their net realisable asset value and expect handsome returns when the market shall eventually rally. A mere study of most of the companies’ performance figures is most informative and points in the direction of a market that will definitely rally as soon as the economic team of government is in place.”  Meanwhile, an analysis of the market performance, it started the week on a negative note, which was   sustained for four trading sessions, shedding 0.8 per cent, 0.5 per cent, 0.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively.  However, the market went up by 0.8 per cent on Friday.
