The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has charged Nigeria’s golf prodigy, Georgia Oboh, to qualify for the prestigious Women’s British Open, one of only two women’s majors played outside the United States. Obaseki, in a statement, urged Oboh to remain focused as she prepares to play in the final stage of the Women’s British Open Qualifying Tournament at Ashridge Golf Club in London. He said, “I urge Georgia Oboh to qualify for the prestigious Women’s British Open and for her to continue showcasing the dogged Edo spirit and talent, which have continued to distinguish our sons and daughters across the globe.” According to him, “The young golfer has our support and we are hopeful that she will make it to the Women’s British Open. All that is required of her is to keep her eyes on qualifying for the tournament and approach the game with a high sense of commitment to represent Edo and Nigeria on the global stage.” He urged the golfer to see herself “As an ambassador of Edo State and Nigeria who has the rare chance to advance a new narrative about Nigeria on the world golf stage. As a former World Teen Champion, Georgia Oboh, has shown versatility and stamina, qualities I believe will drive her to qualify for the Women’s British Open as she has continued to break world records with her display since hitting the limelight.” Oboh will play in the final stage of Women’s British Open Qualifying Tournament having played a score of 75 (3 over par) at the Pre-Qualifying tournament held at Sandy Lodge Golf Club on July 15.
