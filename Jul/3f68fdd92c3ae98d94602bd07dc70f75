Ani said that the commission was currently sending SMS to the telephone numbers of the shortlisted candidates, inviting them for the aptitude test scheduled to start by 8 a.m. He urged candidates to check the comprehensive list from the commissionâ€™s website, www.psc.org.ng or visit the Police Command Headquarters in their respective states and FCT, where the list would be pasted. Ani warned the candidates against any form of examination malpractice as culprits would be apprehended and punished accordingly. (NAN)
