Newcastle United have appointed Steve Bruce as their head coach on a three-year contract. Former Sunderland manager Bruce, 58, resigned as Sheffield Wednesday boss on Monday following talks with the Magpies at the weekend. Newcastle have been without a manager since Rafael Benitez left when his contract expired in June, saying the club “did not share his vision”. Bruce was born near Newcastle and was a boyhood Magpies fan. “There is a huge challenge ahead of us, but it’s one that my staff and I are ready for,” said Bruce. “This is my boyhood club and it was my dad’s club, so this is a very special moment for me and my family.” Bruce will be joined by coaches Steve Agnew and Stephen Clemence, who have been part of his team at a number of his previous clubs.
