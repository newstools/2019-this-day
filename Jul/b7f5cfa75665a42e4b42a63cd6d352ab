 Court of Appeal justices would not go on annual vacation this year to enable them to devote time to hearing of election petition cases that are time bound.
The President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, cancelled this year’s annual vacation for justices of the court, which usually lasts for about two months.
The Media Officer of the Appeal Court, Ms. Sa’adatu Musa-Kachalla, said in a statement yesterday that the directive was due to “the enormous (election) petitions the court is faced with.”
