The federal government yesterday in Abuja affirmed its readiness to deploy biogas for electricity generation in the country. The Head of Department of Environmental Biotechnology and Bio- conservation Department, National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), Dr. Gloria Obioh, stated this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). According to her, the government fabricated bio-digesters adapted to local conditions to generate 20,000MW through conversion of organic wastes. Obioh expressed optimism that the bio-digesters produced by NABDA for electricity generation, would also create jobs and raise the country’s GDP. “The key areas are design and fabrication of bio- digesters to local condition, local patenting of products, and contribution to organic wastes management which accounts to a minimum of 50 per cent municipal solid wastes.” According to her, apart from enhancing food security through the utilisation of bio-fertilizer to boost soil fertility, it will also create jobs across all value chains including digester fabrication, energy generation, waste management, bio-fertilizer production among others. “There will be several spin-off industries which would contribute greatly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), “ she said. Obioha said the bio-digesters would be unveiled today while a train-the –trainer bio-entrepreneurship workshop will take place on Wednesday (tomorrow). She said that investment in the bio-digesters, also called Anaerobic Digestion Technology, would enhance environmental sustainability.
