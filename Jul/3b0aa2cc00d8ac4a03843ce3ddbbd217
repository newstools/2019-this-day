The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it has upheld the expulsion of the party’s National Vice Chairman, North-west, Malam Inuwa Abdulkadir, over anti-party activities by the party’s organs in Sokoto State. The ruling party said this in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu in Abuja yesterday. “The NWC of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has upheld the disciplinary actions of Magajin Gari ‘A’ Ward, Sokoto North Local Government Area, and the party’s Sokoto State Executive Committee on the party’s National Vice Chairman,North-west, Mallam Inuwa Abdulkadir over anti-party activities. “The party organs in Sokoto State have earlier expelled Abdulkadir and passed on their recommendation to the NWC for ratification. “The decision to uphold the action of the Sokoto APC organs was taken at a meeting of the NWC held at the party’s national secretariat on Thursday,” the party spokesman said in the statement. He added that Abdulkadir failed to utilise the opportunity to defend himself before the disciplinary committee set up by the NWC to look into the various petitions received against certain members of the party. “Following the suspension of Abdulkadir, the NWC will subsequently forward the decision of the Sokoto State organs to the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) for further actions,” he said.
