The significance of this Hawan Daushe is to let the people know that their culture has been preserved for a very long time and that the emirate council is working to promote unity within the society,” he added. In addition to refreshing the guests of both emirates with chilled bottles of Malta Guinness, the Malta Guinness Team added fun and excitement to the event with music performances, games and dance contests among others.
