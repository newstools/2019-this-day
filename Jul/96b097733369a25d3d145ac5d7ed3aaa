Olawale Ajimotokan Georgia Oboh will contend with 107 golfers all in the final qualifying tournament for the 44th edition of the Women’s British Open which tees off today at the Ashridge Golf Club, in Little Gaddesden, England. It is a career high for the young professional golfer who is aspiring to become the first Nigerian to feature in the coveted tournament by bidding for one of the places available in the qualifying tournament. Oboh played a score of three over par 75 at the Pre-Qualifying tournament held at Sandy Lodge Golf Club on July 15 to book her place in the final qualifying competition. Oboh told THISDAY she is unfazed by the challenges she had faced so far since turning professional earlier this year, as she is following her dream of becoming the first female Nigerian to win a major title. The one-day tournament will decide those that will join the elite players that had already been listed by the organizers for the championship holding at Woburn Golf Club in Buckinghamshire, England. The teenage sensation has been undergoing her apprenticeship with the PGA of Nigeria (PGAN) under the tutelage of Mathew Lawrence of Ikoyi Club 1938.
