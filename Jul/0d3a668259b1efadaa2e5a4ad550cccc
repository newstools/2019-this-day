The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has taken further steps to ramp up growth in the Nigerian economy, by directing commercial banks to maintain a minimum Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) of 60 per cent effective from September 30, 2019. The LDR was previously at 80 per cent. The central bank stated this in a letter addressed to all banks dated July 3, 2019, which was signed by the Director of Banking Supervision, CBN, Ahmad Abdullahi.

The CBN shall provide a framework for classification of enterprises/businesses that fall under these categories,” it added. More details later…
