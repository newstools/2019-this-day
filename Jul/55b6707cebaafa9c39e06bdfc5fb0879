The president made the pledge while delivering his closing remarks at the end of a two-day presidential policy dialogue session, which lasted for over seven hours and was attended by governors, policy experts, members of the private sector and the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, who was one of the speakers. The president said his administration in the next four years would explore deliberations at the meeting to develop policies aimed at stimulating significant investments that would industrialise the agriculture sector, facilitate private sector participation in infrastructure development, unlock growth potentials in the petroleum sector and improve ease of doing business. He added that such policies would facilitate construction of mass and affordable housing that would foster economic growth and reduce housing deficit and provide incentives for investors, especially in agriculture and power sectors.
According to him, the government will fix the power sector, address security challenges, launch consumer credit scheme to encourage citizens’ access to long-term mortgages and consumer credit. He said: “As we come to the end of this Presidential Policy Dialogue Session, the key proposals made by the experts are for the federal government to consider the following strategic initiatives over the next four years:

God willing, the proposals from this session will be discussed and finalised with them in the coming weeks as they take on their portfolios. “Although most of the proposals were targeted at the federal government, I also want to remind the state governors to do their part, especially in the areas of education and health care, which are within their constitutional responsibilities.”
