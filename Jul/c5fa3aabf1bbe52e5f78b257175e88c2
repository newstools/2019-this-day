The revered monarch said Nigeria needs great minds like Runsewe who are passionate about the promotion of the country’s rich and diverse cultures and expressed his delight at the choice of Benin as host of the next edition of the National Festival for Arts and Culture slated for October. In his address, Runsewe hailed the Oba whose impressive antecedents as Nigeria’s ambassador, he said, ensured the restoration of peace to Angola amongst other noble achievements. The NCAC boss intimated that at least three million people from around the world will be in Benin City for NAFEST, including exhibitors, art collectors, culture enthusiasts and other stakeholders.
