Alex Enumah in Abuja The Supreme Court has set up two panels, comprising of five Justices each to attend to appeals that may likely get to the apex court during the annual vacation, which marks the end of 2018/2019 legal year. According to a statement issued yesterday by the apex court’s Director of Press and Information, Festus Akande, this development arose from the numerous appeals on election-related matters that have been streaming to the court since the conduct of the 2019 general election. “The annual vacation will commence on Monday, July 22, 2019, but the court has constituted two panels that will be sitting during the holiday period in order to see that all election related matters are dealt with. “In view of this development, all parties involved will be contacted through hearing notices”, the statement read.
