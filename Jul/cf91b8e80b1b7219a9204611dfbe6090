Chairman of Conoil Plc, , Mike Adenuga(jnr) had last year  assured  shareholders that conscious efforts would  be directed at achieving better execution of value-added products and services especially in the areas of marketing and customer management. He had said company kept expanding its retail network across the country and the non-fuel retail business was being revamped with a view to achieving future growth targets. According to him, every segment of the business from aviation to LPG to specialised products would continue to receive the desired attention with a view to achieving and maintaining world-class levels of operating and capital discipline. Adenuga said the company was fully charged to consolidate its competitiveness in the different segments of its business by exploring and developing emerging markets while holding its grounds in areas where it has competitive advantage. Towards this goal, he said company introduced into the market, another brand of quality engine oil, Conoil Crown Heavy Duty Oil manufactured specially for the mass market of car owners. “With the introduction of this product, we are poised to fill the yawning void in the industry as a pragmatic marketer of first choice,” Adenuga said. The chairman expressed gratitude to stakeholders for their support for the modest progress it recorded in spite of the odds and the unfriendly business environment it operated last year.
