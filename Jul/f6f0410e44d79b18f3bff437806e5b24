Aliyu disclosed that the board has already invited the remaining 375 intending pilgrims in the last flight to report to the camp from 6 p.m on Wednesday July 31, for their airlift to Saudi Arabia. He explained that the board had concluded arrangements for the last batch which would conclude the airlifting of the intending pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year. He therefore warned the remaining intending pilgrims to report to the camp for the collection of their travel documents and other formalities as scheduled and any intending pilgrim who misses his/her flight should have himself/herself to blame.
