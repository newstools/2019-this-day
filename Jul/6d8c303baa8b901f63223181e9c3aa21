By Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Senate on Tuesday resolved to hold a robust all inclusive national summit to address the rising wave of insecurity across the country. This was sequel to the adoption of a motion moved at plenary by Senator Ayo Akinyelure (Ondo Central) who came under Orders 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules to raise the issue of insecurity in the country, especially the recent killing of the daughter of Afenifere leader, Mrs Funke Olakunrin. Akinyelure who expressed concern over the inability of the government to address the menace moved that the Senate should take decisive step on the matter and act accordingly. The motion was seconded by Senator Tolu Odebiyi (Ogun West) with the upper legislative chamber resolving to urgently convene an all inclusive summit to address the myriad of security problems facing the nation.
