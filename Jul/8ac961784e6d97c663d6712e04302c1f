The Edo State Government has carried out an assessment of the impact of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) on beneficiaries of the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP), N-Power and N-Creative Programmes in the state. The Edo State Focal Person for NSIP, Ms Osayuwamen Aladeshelu visited different centres where she interacted and monitored the performance of the various sub-programmes under the NSIP. Addressing journalists after visiting Eyaen Primary School and two other schools under the NHGSFP, Aladeshelu commended the caterers for complying with the safety standards designed to achieve the objectives of the programme. She explained that from feedbacks, the school community, children and parents are excited about the programme. She noted that the roll-out of the programme in the state was made possible with the support of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration. At Eyaen Senior Secondary School, the focal person and her team met with 22 beneficiaries posted to the school under the N-teach programme. One of the beneficiaries, Joy Egwoum, appealed for the beneficiaries to be fully engaged by government. The team also visited the Oredo Skills Acquisition Centre where beneficiaries under the N-build training programme are being trained on various technical and vocational skills. Mrs Clementina Ekhomogiazin, a master trainer in catering at the centre, encouraged youths to take advantage of the programme and not wait for white collar jobs. She said the programme was designed to empower and make youths self-reliant, adding that government has provided the basics needed for entrepreneurs to set up businesses.
