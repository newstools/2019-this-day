With the continued bearish trading, the market has recorded a year-to-date decline of 10.28 per cent as at yesterday. A total of 32 stocks depreciated compared with 10 that appreciated. Market operators attributed the negative performance to lack of policy direction by the federal government following non-appointment of ministers to drive the economy among other factors.

Given the challenging operating environment in Apapa, where the company is located, selling and distribution expenses rose 32 per cent from N6.180 billion to N8.166 billion, while administrative expenses remained at N19.424 billion, compared with N19.423 billion in 2018.
