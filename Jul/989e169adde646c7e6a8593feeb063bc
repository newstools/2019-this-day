Adesina said Buhari would sign the AfCFTA agreement on the margins of the AU meeting in Niamey, citing the remarks of the president while receiving the committee report on June 27. ”For AfCFTA to succeed, we must develop policies that promote African production, among other benefits. ”Africa, therefore, needs not only a trade policy but also a continental manufacturing agenda. Our vision for intra-African trade is for the free movement of ‘made in Africa goods.’ That is, goods and services made locally with dominant African content in terms of raw materials and value addition,” he quoted the president. According to the statement, Buhari will be accompanied to Niamey by the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, Governors Babagana Zulum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu and Aminu Bello Masari of Borno, Kebbi and Katsina States respectively.
