We have consistently made it clear that the command welcomes only compliant traders who are willing to operate in accordance with extant laws and guidelines. We have also shown a clear resolve to deal ruthlessly with importers and agents who manifest a recalcitrant attitude to obeying Customs laws. “Since we are in a modern customs environment, we maintain open lines of communication between all governments agencies at all times. The process of information sharing within the agencies goes a long way in assisting us to identify and neutralise all possible avenues that could lead to compromises in revenue and security. “The seizures made so far are products of synergy between the command, other units within the service and other security agencies. These units include Customs Intelligence Unit, CGC Strike Force, Valuation, Customs Police and Post Clearance Audit while other security agencies include the Nigeria Police force, Nigeria immigration service, the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), officers of Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and Nigerian Navy,” he said.
