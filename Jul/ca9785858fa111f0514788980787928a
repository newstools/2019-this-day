Three Civil Servants kidnapped by suspected  herdsmen last Friday in Ekiti State, have been freed from captivity. The workers, led  by one Ayoola Alabi and two other junior staff are employees of the Ekiti State Road Maintenance Agency (EKROMA). They were reportedly  kidnapped along Ayede – Isan Ekiti road last Friday. A family source told journalists in Ado Ekiti yesterday that the captives paid N1 million ransom each to secure their freedom . The abductors had earlier demanded  for N10m as ransom on the trio. The source said : “Yes, they were released yesterday after they paid N1m each”. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed the release. He, however, said the abductees were freed through the prompt and decisive actions taken by the police. “Immediately we heard about the kidnapping, our men bombarded the forest located between Ayede and Isan up to Ijesamodu where they were taken to. We combed everywhere and when they knew we were closing in on them, they quickly released those held  hostage and fled . Our men were very careful to avoid crossfire with the abductors , so that the hostages won’t be killed in the process and it worked out”, he said . Ikechukwu said the police were never told whether the families paid ransom to anyone. “I can’t confirm whether ransom was paid, because we were not told and there was no need for that with the level of strategies that we deployed”.
