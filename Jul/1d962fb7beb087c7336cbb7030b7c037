By James Sowole in Akure  “We can’t continue that way, it is not just possible, because we can’t talk about managing the economy of this country if people are not safe.  Economy is for the people, they must be alive to enjoy infrastructure. Even if you tar all the roads in the country and people cannot move around, then the road become meaningless. “The issue of security must be approached from a different dimension, we cannot continue the old way because it is getting out of hand”.
