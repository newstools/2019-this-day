In his speech, Governor Mohammed lamented that the state had suffered years of neglect by his predecessors and charged the new principal officers to join hands with him to move the state forward. He said that the new appointments were purely based on merit devoid of political sentiments. The governor said: “Bauchi has suffered a lot of neglect in the past by my predecessors and this is not to underplay their contributions to the development of the state. “Being here is a burden. A burden that can only be accountable to God and to the people who voted us into office.” He lamented that the state has prevalence of ghost workers in the civil service, which has overstretched the finances of the government, pointing out that “our wage bill rose from N4 billion to over N7 billion because of the prevalence of ghost workers even at the local government areas”. Mohammed, who stated that most of the monies that came into the state in the past were “put in private pockets”, pledged the loyalty of his administration to the people of the state. According to him, “Bauchi State in the past received N1 billion monthly from the federal government for the school feeding programme but most of our children did not really benefit because most of the money were put in private pockets. “Bauchi got over N20 billion for the Social Investment Programme from the federal government. So, the office of the Special Adviser Social Investment is more than 10 commissioners.” He said that he will not victimize anyone but will try to deal with the problems the state is faced with squarely.
