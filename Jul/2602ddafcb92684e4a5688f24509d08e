Boeing has earmarked the sum of $100 million ‘in funds’ to address family and community needs of those affected by the tragic accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. The aircraft manufacturer in a statement said, “These funds will support education, hardship and living expenses for impacted families, community programs, and economic development in impacted communities. “Boeing will partner with local governments and non-profit organisations to address these needs. This initial investment will be made over multiple years.” “We at Boeing are sorry for the tragic loss of lives in both of these accidents and these lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and on our minds for years to come. “The families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort,” said Boeing Chairman, president and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg.
