And I’m delighted that I was able to overcome the stage fright at the start of the match and I the end we won. “Let me also say that I’m not here to take anybody’s position but just to co tribute my quota into the team. It is let to the coach to select his team and everyone here is qualify to play for Nigeria,” he said.
