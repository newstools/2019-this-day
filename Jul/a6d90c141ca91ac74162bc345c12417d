Ghana is the latest country to be granted a visa-free status by the South African government. South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs has added Ghana to a list of seven countries whose nationals will be permitted to enter South Africa visa-free. Nigeria was not included despite the large volume of trade between the two countries. South Africa announced in September 2018 that it was finalising a number of visa waiver agreements with other countries including Ghana to allow travellers to enter the country without a visa. According to the Minister of Home Affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, citizens of the seven countries are able to enter South Africa without a visa. “Tourism will soar if we relax visa requirements for entry into South Africa. We know that Tourism is very important for job creation,” he said Thursday at a briefing in South Africa. “Out of the 193 countries who are member states of the United Nations, the Department has granted visa-free status to 75 countries. Of these, 16 are in our continent and are SADC members and 59 are from all over the world.” (NAN)
