By Shola Oyeyipo in Abuja The House of Representatives has finally approved N30, 000 as the New national Minimum Wage. President Muhammadu Buhari had sent a N27, 000 minimum wage bill to the National Assembly last week Thursday. But the lawmakers adopted the report by the ad-hoc committee set up on the New Minimum Wage Bill which held a public hearing Monday and presented the report to the National Assembly.  The bill has already been passed for the third reading. The lawmakers were unanimously in support of the adoption of the N30, 000 recommendation by the committee, which labour leaders insisted was approved by the tripartite committee set up by the President.
