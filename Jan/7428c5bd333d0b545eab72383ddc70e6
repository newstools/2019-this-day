By Azuka Ogujiuba It was a fun night of glamour and electrifying excitement as the Nigerian Maritime Safety and Administration Agency (NIMASA) once again gathered an audience filled with the crème de la crème for its annual corporate dinner and awards ceremony. The event, which held at Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos, recently, was to bring together all players in maritime, to appreciate NIMASA staff and stakeholders’ commitment, professionalism and resilience. All night, staff members, stakeholders and friends were entertained with awards bestowed on the most impactful maritime industry players. There was a lineup of A-list performers and chart toppers keeping guests entertained through the evening. Mr. Eazi; Paul Okoye of the defunct PSquare; Flavor; Tiwa Savage; and celebrity disc jockey, DJ Lambo, were all at their best.
