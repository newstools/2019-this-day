Vitoria was removed from his position at Benfica last Thursday following a poor spell of results, bringing to an end his three-and-a-half year tenure. Mourinho has has been out of a job since being axed from his position of United boss in early December, following a humiliating 3-1 defeat to bitter rivals Liverpool.

Mourinho actually began his managerial career at Benfica, spending a six-month period with the club before swiftly moving on due to a breakdown in contract talks.
