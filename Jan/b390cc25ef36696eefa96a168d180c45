Dalyop added, “On Wednesday, gunmen arrived at Kwata community around 7p.m. Before you knew what was happening, they just opened fire on the people while shouting ‘Allahu AK’hubar’ during the operation. “When they finished and ran away, six people laid dead, including a former Councilor who relocated to the community from Barki Ladi Local Government Area. What we are witnessing in various communities in Plateau State is a new form of unprovoked aggression against the people and the government and the security agents must rise in defence of the communities before the gunmen wreck more havoc on innocent civilians.” The Governor of Plateau State, Mr. Simon Lalong, through his Commissioner for Information, Mr. Yakubu Dati, in a statement, said he has directed the security agents to arrest the recent resurgence in the state.
