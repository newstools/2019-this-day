Top seed Novak Djokovic set up a tantalising Australian Open final against Rafael Nadal by thrashing Lucas Pouille in a one-sided semi-final. The Serb, 31, needed just one hour and 23 minutes to win 6-0 6-2 6-2. Djokovic broke serve seven times as he outclassed 24-year-old Frenchman Pouille, seeded 28th and in his first Grand Slam semi-final. Djokovic and Spaniard Nadal – who have 31 Grand Slams titles between them – meet on Sunday. The world number one set up their first meeting in Melbourne since their epic six-hour final in 2012 – which the Serb eventually won – with a near flawless performance against Pouille. He made just five unforced errors and hit 29 winners on Rod Laver Arena. “It is definitely one of the best matches I’ve ever had on this court,” said the 14-time major winner. “Everything worked how I imagined it before the match – it was a tough one for Lucas.” Djokovic, is aiming for a seventh Australian Open crown, which would move him clear of Roy Emerson and Roger Federer in terms of all-time victories in Melbourne. Nadal, who would trail Federer by two if he wins his 18th major, could become the first man to claim a second career Grand Slam in the Open era. Over the past two nights, we have seen two utterly dominant and ruthless performances by two players who have proved to be a hefty cut above the rest. Djokovic was only credited with five unforced errors. It was another immaculate performance by the world number one – he matched Nadal stroke for stroke.
