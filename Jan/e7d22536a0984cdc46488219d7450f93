Katsina is the home state President Muhammadu Buhari and it is an All Progressives Congress controlled state. The security situation is tight in and around the secretariat as the Nigeria Police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps; the Army, DSS and other paramilitary personnel were on standby to ensure security and a hitch -free campaign flag off.
