Onnoghen is to be arraigned this morning by the Federal government over allegations of non declaration of his assets. As early as 8am when our correspondent got to the venue, the place was already condoned off by security operatives who screened persons going into the premises of the tribunal. Over 10 Senior advocates alongside dozens of other lawyes are already in court in line with the call of NBA, Paul Usoro SAN, to show solidarity with the CJN.
