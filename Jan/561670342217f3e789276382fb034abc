Seriki Adinoyi in Jos Seven persons have again been following attacks by gunmen on to communities in Barki Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State. The latest attacks occurred on Sunday night in two up communities of Dorong and Nding, within the area council. Five of the victims, who were returning home after a picnic organised by a Christian youth fellowship in Jos, were said to have been gunned down by the assailants, who had laid ambush on them close to Nding Community bridge, while the other two victims died when the gunmen suspected to be Fulani herders invaded Dorong community. The names of the victims of the attack in Nding community could not be immediately ascertained, but a resident of the community, Mr. Solomon Dalyop, who confirmed the killings, gave the names of the other two as Miss Janet Markus and Mr. Dung Pam. Dalyop said on phone, “I’m at the scene of the incident as I talk with you. At 6:20p.m. on Sunday, COCIN Youth Fellowship of Gassa and Nding communities of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area were ambushed at Nding community bridge when they were heading back home from celebrating Christmas at Wildlife Park in Jos, Plateau State capital.
“The attack claimed at least five lives while the injured ones have been rushed to the hospital. “Also on Sunday evening, armed Fulani herdsmen invaded Dorong Community and killed Miss Janet Markus and Dung Pam.
“With the fresh killings that have been sustained in the past few days, we are beginning to agree with the rumour we heard that some armed Fulani have been moved to the communities to disrupt the peace in certain communities in the state during the Christmas and new year festival and ensure that the killings continue so that there will be no election in Berom land because of insecurity. “We call on government and the security agents to act swiftly and safe the people from the situation and also ensure that those behind the fresh hostilities against the people do not succeed in their evil agenda.” Confirming the killings, state command Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO) Mr. Terna Tyopev, said, “On the 30/12/2018 at 1815hrs, the Plateau State Police Command, Jos received a distress call from Samson Bitrus of Gwom Nding Village that on the same date at 1800hrs some unknown gunmen attacked a Peugeot 504 Station Wagon on the way to Nding Village.” He said the Commissioner of Police Plateau State Command, Mr. Austin Agbonlahor, having received the information immediately assembled a team that raced to the scene of crime but found that the attackers had left the scene of crime.
