Bolton Wanderers have made a move for ex-Hibernian defender Efe Ambrose. The 30-year-old is available on a free transfer after exercising a clause in his contract though he has been offered new terms at Hibs. The Scottish club recognised Ambrose was a key performer for them and want to keep him at the club after the departure of manager Neil Lennon by mutual consent. Ambrose has vast experience from his time with Celtic, for whom he played between 2012 and 2017. This season Ambrose has produced some excellent performances, which has prompted much interest from other clubs. Bolton are hopeful of reaching agreement but Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday and Wigan Athletic have all made late enquiries. The 6ft 3ins centre back has 51 caps for Nigeria but has qualified for British passport
