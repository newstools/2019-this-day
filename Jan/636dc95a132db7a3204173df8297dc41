Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has been warned by the Football Association about his behaviour during Thursday’s 2-1 victory over Liverpool. Guardiola threw his scarf to the ground and shouted at fourth official Martin Atkinson after a decision had gone against his team in the second half. This is the 47-year-old Spaniard’s first warning. If any manager receives four such warnings then they must serve a touchline ban.
