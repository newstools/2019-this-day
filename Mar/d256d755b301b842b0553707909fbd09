From Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi After over 18 hours of waiting for the commencement of collation of Saturday’ s governorship (supplementary) election in Bauchi State, results have been announced with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, scoring the highest number of votes. Mohammed secured about 6,376 votes, while his closest rival and incumbent governor, Barrister Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar, of APC, scored 5,117 votes. However, the returning officer could not make a return and declaration of governor elect because election was not conducted in Tafawa Balewa Local Government, one of the places where elections where cancelled, due to litigation. A Federal High Court will on Monday decide on whether election will hold in Tafawa Balewa LGA. Announcing the results, the Returning Officer, Prof. Kyari Mohammed said, “ As you well know, I cannot make a return because I understand that the case of Tafawa Balewa LGA is in court.” Supplementary elections were held in 36 Polling Units in 29 Wards across 15 Local Government Areas of the state on Saturday.
