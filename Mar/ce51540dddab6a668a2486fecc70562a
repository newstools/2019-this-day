The judiciary arm of government has never had it so bad like itâ€™s being tossed left and right under this dispensation of Muhammadu Buhari. It being stripped of its dignity and completely emasculated (apology here to our female jurists for my choice of a colourful word); nonetheless, that is the painful fact. The Chief Justice of Nigeria has been sacked, other notable justices have been harassed, judges have been publicity shamed, etc. The surprise here is how Nigerians decide to allow illegitimate executive actions to rule supreme. Now that Candidate Atiku Abubakar is heading for the courts to seek redress over the electoral fraud that deprived him of the presidency, all eyes are on the judiciary to see how it reacts after being boxed and cowed into a whimpering dark corner for too long now. Of course, no one in asking the judiciary to do anything untoward to favour Atiku but the judiciary must now adjudicate based on available and prevailing facts. This is what jurists have been sworn to do. Sunday Adole Jonah, Department of Physics, Federal University of Technology, Minna Niger State
