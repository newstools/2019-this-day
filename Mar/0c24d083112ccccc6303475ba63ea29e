Organisers of the Okpekpe International 10km Road Race have given Wednesday, May 22, as the closing date for registration of athletes for the seventh edition of the only IAAF Silver Label road running event in Africa in 2019 which holds on Saturday May 25 in Okpekpe, Edo State. Zak Amodu, the race’s Director of Organisation said the online registration for the historic race will close on Wednesday, May 22nd, 2019. ”Accreditation and number pick up will begin on Thursday, May 23 and end the next day, Friday May 24. It will start at 8:00 a.m. each day at Yak Hotel along Auchi-Benin Road,” revealed Amodu who insisted that there will be no accreditation on race day. ”To pick up your race number you will need to print a copy of your order confirmation email or Order Number and present a form of identification (a driver’s licence, school ID, etc.)”. Amodu who also revealed that those who are unable to make it to the pick-up venue can send a third party to pick it up for them with proper form of identification. “We feel it is important to give this registration timeline very early because of the nature of the race. It is an IAAF silver label race which means it is a world-class race comparable to all the other silver label road races across the globe. “We thus want to tidy up logistics for the administrative and technical organisation of the race very early,” said Amodu Like it was last year, this year’s edition will be the first IAAF Silver Label 10km race of the year. It will hold six days after the IAAF Gold Label Tata Consultancy Services World 10km in Bengaluru, India on May 19 and on the same day the IAAF Gold Label Ottawa 10k holds in Ottawa, Canada. The Okpekpe International 10km Road Race is organised by Pamodzi Sports Marketing, leaders in sports marketing with the technical assistance from the Athletics Federation of Nigeria.
