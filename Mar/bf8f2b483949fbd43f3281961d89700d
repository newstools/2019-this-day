Timber dealers at Kenyatta Market, Enugu have assured Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of their votes saying March 9 will be pay back time for his past support. The timber dealers, whose sheds were gutted by fire on March 5, 2018, recalled how Gov. Ugwuanyi, who is the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, wiped their tears by rebuilding their burnt shops and giving each of them N100,000 as grant to re-establish their businesses. The dealers told him that they will pay him back with their massive votes at the polls. Gov. Ugwuanyi and the PDP train on Friday were at the Kenyatta Market, and other markets in Enugu, such as Eke Otu in Amechi Awkunanaw, Garki, and Coal Camp, in continuation of their intense door-to-door campaign ahead of the March 9 governorship and state assembly elections canvassing vigorously for votes. The governor told the traders and supporters to take the message that “PDP is the way to go” to their families and neighbourhood, stressing that “a vote for Gburugburu is a vote for all the candidates of the PDP in Enugu State”. Responding, the traders and residents of the state who trooped out in their numbers, dancing and singing solidarity songs, told Gov. Ugwuanyi that he did not need to come and campaign to them, as he already had their votes and support.
