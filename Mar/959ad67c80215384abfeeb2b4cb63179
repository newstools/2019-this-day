The Lagos Irish Pub at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos, is planning big for St Patrick’s Day, Ireland’s national holiday, which commemorates the foremost patron saint of Ireland and is held annually on March 17. This year’s edition falls on a Sunday and from 1pm to 9pm, the Lagos Irish Pub is offering guests an all-you-can-eat barbeque buffet and three beers for a nominal fee. Lagos Irish Pub is a charming wooden traditional pub with live music and an outdoor patio, and combines a luxury setting with a convivial atmosphere. “Celebrate one of the most popular Irish holidays with us at the Lagos Irish Pub. Dive into the spirit of the holiday with shots of Jameson or for our traditional beer lovers, cold pints of Heineken,” said the manager of LIP, Dimitrios Mamalis. “With an all you can eat barbeque and a live band, it will be the ultimate St. Paddy’s affair in Lagos. Be Eko-friendly. Save water and drink beer,” he added. The cultural and religious celebration was made an official Christian feast day in the early 17th century. It commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general. Historically, the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol were lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday’s tradition of alcohol consumption. St Patrick’s Day is widely celebrated around the world and is celebrated in more countries than any other national festival.
