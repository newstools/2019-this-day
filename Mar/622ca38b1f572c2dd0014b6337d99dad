Schneider Electric and its partners were seen touring the Lagos Island and Oshodi electrical markets while on a two-day roadshow which began Wednesday, with the aim of educating the public on electrical safety, and the importance of getting genuine equipment and installations. The tour which lasted hours on each of these days was packed with electricians, distributors, retailers, and partners of Schneider Electric. Representatives of the company highlighted the benefits of patronising genuine products. Members of the Schneider Electricians Club received incentives which included free technical training; access to discounts; and earned loyalty points which can be redeemed as gift items. This reward system is the company’s strategy to promote original products and boost electricians’ loyalty. Speaking at the function was the Managing Director for Schneider Electric Anglophone West Africa, Mr Christophe Begat. He said, “For Schneider Electric, safety is paramount, and that’s why we partner with companies that guarantee the authenticity of the products that are sold. We are happy to collaborate with them in sensitising the public about the importance of safe practices and patronising original appliances”. A recent statistics from the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency showed that 190 people were victims of 146 electrical accidents in 2017. Of these, 113 died in 95 accidents while 77 others sustained injuries in another 51 accidents. Schneider Electric, Nigerchin, and its other partners posit that the use of genuine electrical appliances would reduce the casualty level from electrical accidents nationwide.
