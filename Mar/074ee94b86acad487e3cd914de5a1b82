2019 FIBA 3×3 World Cup Nigeria’s senior men’s 3×3 national basketball team has been grouped alongside France, Germany and Italy in Group A for a place in the 2019 FIBA 3×3 World Cup. The men’s team currently ranked 76th in the world and 10th in Africa failed to secure an automatic qualification after falling short of the FIBA Africa Cup title in Benin Republic. They face the 3×3 super powers in San Juan, Puerto Rico between May 4th and 5th. Despite being the underdogs in the group, the team will hope to defeat world number 25, Germany and Italy ranked 17th on the global ranking table if they are to stand a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. The FIBA 3×3 Africa Cup 2017 winners will have their hands full when they come up against FIBA 3×3 World Cup 2016 bronze medalists France. Team captain and Rivers Hoopers Basketball club new recruit, Abdul Yahaya believes the team stands a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. “We learnt vital lessons during the 2018 edition in the Philippines and we hope to bring that to bare when we get to San Juan.” Although, it is not going to be an easy task, we are not going to just fold our arms and let Germany, Italy or France have an easy ride over us.” Group A and B winners automatically qualify for the semifinals while the 2nd and 3rd placed teams will play in the quarterfinals to determine the other 2 semifinalists. Winners of the semifinals will qualify for the FIBA 3×3 World Cup 2019 holding in Amsterdam The Netherlands between June 18 and 23. Losers of the semifinals will play a final game for the final spot.
