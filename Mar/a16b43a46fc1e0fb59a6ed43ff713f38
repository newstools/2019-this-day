A civil liberty organisation, African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD), has commended Edo State Government for demonstrating commitment to the Open Government Partnership (OGP), tailored towards promoting transparency and accountability in governance.  In a media briefing to commemorate the 2019 OGP week in Abuja, programme coordinator, Centre LSD, Uchenna Arisukwu, commended Edo, Kaduna, Kano, Anambra, Ebonyi, Abia, Enugu, Niger, and Adamawa for signing up to and domesticating the OGP and developing a state-level action plan.  Arisukwu explained that as OGP will “ensure transparency is adhered to in procurement systems.”  Recall that the Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ) decorated Governor Godwin Obaseki, with the Open Government Champions Award, for implementing policy actions to promote fiscal transparency, anti-corruption, access to information, citizen engagement, accountability in governance and for leading the OGP campaign in the South-South region.  Other members of the Obaseki-led administration decorated by ANEEJ for advancing principles of OGP, include Chief of Staff to the Governor, Chief Taiwo Akerele, and Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General of the state, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe.  Checks showed that Edo State Government signed and deployed open government portal in partnership with the World Bank eight years ago.  In addition, the state government is deploying energy and resources to improve the ease of doing business in the state, embracing Information Communication Technology (ICT) to make government processes stress-free.
