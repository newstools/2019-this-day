Zinedine Zidane has returned as Real Madrid manager just 10 months after leaving the Spanish giants. The Frenchman replaces Santiago Solari, who was in charge for less than five months. Former Real midfielder Zidane, 46, who left in May after leading the club to a third straight Champions League trophy, has agreed to take over until 2022, the club announced. Real are currently third in La Liga, 12 points behind leaders Barcelona. Solari was sacked after a 4-1 win over Real Valladolid on Sunday â€“ which followed a shock Champions League exit to Ajax. That 4-1 home defeat and 5-3 aggregate loss to the Dutch side was the final straw for Real president Florentino Perez.
