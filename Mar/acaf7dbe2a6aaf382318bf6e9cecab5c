Duro Ikhazuagbe After AELEX picked the first win of Group A in the 2019 BOA Lawyers’ Football League that commenced last weekend, the law firm will today try to consolidate on that victory when they confront Perchstone & Graeys LP this afternoon at AstroTurf 2000 in Ikoyi, Lagos. Similarly, favourites Falana & Falana leading Group B on three points have a date to keep with another past winner of the tournament, Lagos State Ministry of Justice (LSMJ) in top of the billing clash.

Falana defeated Wole Olanipekun/Dele Adeshina 1-0, UUBO/ACAS Law drew goalless with LSMJ, while SOOB/NICCOM LLP beat Pinheiro LP 2-0.
