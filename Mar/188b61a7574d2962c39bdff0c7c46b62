CYPRUS WOMEN’S CUP Nigeria’s senior women national team; the Super Falcons received a boost ahead of their clash with Slovakia today in the Cyprus Women’s Cup following the arrival of star attacker Francisca Ordega and left back Ngozi Ebere to the team’s camp Both players missed Wednesday’s annihilation in the hands of Russia in Larnaca but team’s Head Coach Thomas Dennerby confirmed yesterday afternoon that they have now joined up with the rest of their teammates. “Now, we have all players here finally. Ngozi Ebere arrived today (Thursday) and Ordega (Francisca) arrived last night so they couldn’t be in the first game,” said the Swede to www.aclsports.com Now that everybody is here, we hope that everybody is fit so we can try to bring out a really good team against Belgium on Monday. Of course we’ll bring out a good team tomorrow (Friday) also but we can’t play the best players four games in a row because we are in preparation times,” added Dennerby. Reigning African champions Nigeria will face Slovakia in their second group game this morning (11am Nigerian time) at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca, Cyprus. Just like Nigeria who lost 1-4 to Austria in their opening game on Wednesday, Slovakia also lost 3-0 to Belgium in the group’s first game. The Super Falcons’ first loss could however easily be hinged on goalkeeper Tochukwu Oluehi’s fifth minute dismissal against the Austrians.
