Senator Peter Adeyemo has congratulated Oyo Governor-elect, Seyi Makinde, on his victory in Saturday’s gubernatorial election, noting that his victory is well-deserved. Senator Adeyemo, who represented Oyo South Senatorial District in the Senate between 1999 and 2003 on the platform of the Alliance for Democracy, urged Makinde to use the mandate given to him by the people of the state to make Oyo the pride of all states. “Oyo State is known as the pacesetter and we must continue to set the pace for others to follow. My prayer for the governor-elect is that the Almighty God will give him the wisdom required to administer the affairs of this great state”, he said. Adeyemo also urged the people of the state to join hands and support the new administration that will take off on May 29, so that it can deliver the dividends of democracy. “Now that elections are over, let’s us all come together in the interest of our state and support Eng. Seyi Makinde,” he said.
