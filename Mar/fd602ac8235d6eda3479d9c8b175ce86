Laleye Dipo in Minna A female commissioner in the cabinet of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, Mrs Amina Musa Gua’ar, has been suspended by her local government chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The suspension, which took effect from Friday last week, was indefinite. Mrs Gua’ar, the Commissioner for Women Affairs who also oversees the school feeding programme of the federal government, was suspended for alleged involvement in anti-party activities during the last general election. The Paikoro Local Government branch Working Committee, which handed down the suspension claimed that it invited Gua’ar to give her part of the story but she declined to honour an official letter sent to her. The suspension letter reads: “In reference to a letter dated 18th March, 2019, the local government executive working committee of the APC in Paikoro has resolved to utilize Article 21, Section A, Subsection 111 of the Constitution as amended disobedience or negligence in carrying out lawful directive of the party “This is due to your refusal/disobedience to abide by the party’s directive within the stipulated time frame. “Sequel to this, I hereby notify you of your suspension from the party until further notice.” The letter, which was signed by the party’s chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Kwana, was made available to newsmen in Minna on Sunday. The letter was copied to the APC stakeholders, zonal chairman, APC state secretary and chairman as well as the Political Adviser to the Governor and Secretary to the State Government (SSG). However when contacted on phone, the state secretary of the party, Alhaji Mohammed Liman, said he was yet to receive a copy of the letter “probably because we are in a weekend”. All efforts to get in touch with the female commissioner was abortive as her cell phones were off.
