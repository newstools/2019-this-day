The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, Hon. Oladipupo Adebutu, has debunked the rumours making the rounds that he has agreed to work with another political party or has adopted a candidate in Saturday’s elections in the state. In a statement by the Media Consultant, Ladi Adebutu Democratic Organisation, Adebutu said: “Unequivocally, we want to state that at no point did Hon. Adebutu made such agreement neither did he promise any alliance with any party or individual within or outside the state. “This unfounded rumour is in the widest imagination of those who spread them and we encourage our teeming supporters to reject them and their failed mission. “We understand that the rising popularity of Hon. Adebutu as a frontrunner in the contest, despite the legal battles which we believe will soon be rested, is giving other candidates sleepless nights, and are hoping to lean and rely on successes of Hon. Adebutu who is Ogun people’s best choice to realize their ambitions.” The statement said the organisation urges those in the sham publicity stunt to retrace their steps and focus wholly on selling their agenda to the people of Ogun State. It said Adebutu is committed to returning the state and her citizens to the path of prosperity and is busy engaging stakeholders on how to hit the ground running the moment he is declared winner in the March 9 elections on the platform of PDP. According to the statement, “We therefore urge the good people of Ogun State to go out en mass on Saturday, March 9 to vote the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for governorship and House of Assembly candidate.”
