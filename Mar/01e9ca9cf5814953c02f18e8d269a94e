*Watford welcomes Rodger back with defeat *Chelsea wins Everton ensured Manchester City remained top of the Premier League as they produced a battling performance to hold Liverpool to a goalless draw at Goodison Park. Liverpool needed victory to leapfrog City after their win at Bournemouth but Jurgen Klopp’s side lacked the cutting edge to break the deadlock in a tense Merseyside derby. Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, the villain when Divock Origi scored Liverpool’s 96th-minute winner at Anfield in December, was the hero with a brilliant first-half save from Mohamed Salah, who was denied by a superb last-ditch challenge from Michael Keane after the break. Manchester City now stand a point clear with nine games remaining. Also yesterday, Fulham Caretaker Manager Scott Parker said he is planning for the long term after his first match in charge ended in a narrow 2-1 defeat by Chelsea. The Premier League strugglers produced a much-improved performance in their first game since the sacking of Claudio Ranieri, but remain deep in relegation trouble. With nine matches remaining, they are 10 points from safety and have lost eight of their past nine league games. Earlier yesterday, Troy Deeney insisted there will be no Watford “meltdown” this season after the Hornets continued their impressive campaign with a late 2-1 victory over Leicester in Brendan Rodgers’ first game in charge of the Foxes. Second-half substitute Andre Gray finished coolly past Kasper Schmeichel in injury time to lift the hosts level on points with seventh-placed Wolves. Deeney had given Watford an early lead, heading Gerard Deulofeu’s cross past Schmeichel.
