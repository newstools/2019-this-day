Oguntimehin in the statement expressed satisfaction at the success of the campaign, stating that this was what the mobile is all about, “we love our fans and what better way to show it, than to encourage them to show love to their favourite people while we also give them a memorable experience” The statement added: “Out of the tons of interesting and creative entries that included a lady acting as a bus conductor and another taking over the role of a suya merchant, Azeezat Lawal, Anita Clement, Ofere Oluwatobi and Oluwatoni Animashaun were selected as winners as they had the most creative dare responses with the highest number of views.”
