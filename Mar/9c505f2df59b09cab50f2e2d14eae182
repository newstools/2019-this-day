At the meeting,Governor Obaseki told the gathering which had the Sports Minister,Barrister Solomon Dalung in attendance as well as the directors of Sports from the 36 states of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory that this year’s race will serve to benchmark subsequent editions.
Obaseki,who has been a strong supporter of the first road race in Nigeria and West Africa to get an IAAF label rating since its inception in 2013 also used the opportunity to invite the Sports Minister to this year’s race which holds on Saturday May 25 in Okpekpe,a rusty town in Etsako East local government of Edo state. ‘I am using this opportunity to invite the Honourable Sports Minister as well as the whole world to world class road race holding on May 25 in Okpekpe town here in Edo state,’said Obaseki while extolling Barrister Dalung for reviving the National Sports Festival. “For whatever you did or did not do, history will be fair to you for rescuing the National Sports Festival.Today you have spoken about retirement and the imminent dissolution of the National Executive Council, but before you go, permit me to invite you to come and race with me at the Okpekpe Road Race.’ In his response,the Sports Minister promised to be present at the only IAAF Silver label road race that will be run in West Africa this year.
”I will always be part of the Okpekpe Road Race whether I am in office or not.It is a well organized event that has helped to elevate and dignify the organizational prowess of Nigeria,”said Dalung.
