By Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto The Sokoto State Police Command has confirmed the death of two policemen — ASP Abdullahi Maisaje and Sgt Usman Ibrahim — while on election duty. Briefing journalists in Sokoto Wednesday, the command’s Commissioner of Police, Mr Aminu Kogi, said the officers were ambushed by gunmen on their way to Isa Local Government Area on Friday, March 8 in preparation for the March 9 governorship and House of Assembly elections. He commiserated with the bereaved families, saying they died in the service of their fatherland. He urged the families to take solace in God, saying that God gives and God takes. Kogi announced the donation of N2 million to the family of Maisaje and N1 million to the family of Ibrahim from the state Governor Aminu Tambuwal. He applauded Tambuwal for the gesture, saying that the donation was not a compensation for the dead as no amount could bring them back to life. The commissioner handed over the money to the wives of the deceased persons. Responding, Mrs Maryam Abubakar, the wife of Maisaje, thanked the governor for the kind gesture. She said that her husband was the bread winner of the family, adding that her husband left behind nine children — four boys and five girls.
