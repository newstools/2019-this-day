Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has described late industrialist, Dr. Efianayi Iyayi, as an icon who lived a life of selfless service, hard work, industry, honesty and integrity. Addressing journalists at Egba, home town of late Iyayi and venue of the social dance in honour of the deceased, Obaseki said the state government will immortalise late Iyayi. “We acknowledge what he has done for us. As a people, we have to ensure we immortalise his name,” he noted. He said, “We are here to celebrate his life and pay tribute to him. With the attendance here, you can see that late Iyayi was an Icon.” Obaseki added that Iyayi lived a great and fulfilled life, urging the children to emulate their late father by putting into use the skills, knowledge and experience they acquired from him. First son of the deceased, Dr. Caesar Iyayi, said he was humbled by the life his father lived and expressed appreciation to guests who showed support to his family after the demise of his late father. He said the family will work together, caring for one another to ensure everyone is successful. Not surprised by the over 6,000 guests at the social dance, Mr. Caesar said his father showed concern for the needs of others, noting, “My late father constructed schools, roads, hospitals and gave out scholarships. We never knew people were watching and today we have over 6,000 people who came to pay their last respect to him.”
