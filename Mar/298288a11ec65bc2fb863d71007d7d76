By Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, on Wednesday described the late Etsu Patigi, Alhaji Umar Chatta Ibrahim, as a man of peace whose reign witnessed monumental development particularly in his domain and Kwara State in general. Saraki, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Yusuph Olaniyonu, expressed sadness over the death of the foremost traditional ruler in Kwara State.
According to him, “Alhaji Ibrahim was an older friend and an ardent supporter. I will personally miss his advice and fatherly disposition. He was always an apostle of peace and good relationship between the various peoples and areas in our dear state. He shall be dearly missed. “The last time I saw him was during the electioneering, he was lively and articulate about the hopes and aspirations of the people of Patigi, in particular, and the Kwara North Senatorial District in general. As usual, one saw a traditional ruler who tirelessly canvassed the interest of his people. One never realised it was the last meeting we had that day,” Saraki stated. The Senate President commiserated with the immediate family of the deceased, Patigi community, the Etsu in Council, Kwara State Traditional Council and the people and government of Kwara State over the irreparable loss.
He prayed Allah to grant the soul of the departed royal father a place among the righteous ones in Aljannah Firdaus and his loved ones, the fortitude to bear the loss.
