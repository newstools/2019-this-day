By John Shiklam in Kaduna The trial of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) also known as Shiites, Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky, has been adjourned indefinitely by the trial judge, Justice Gideon Kurada of the Kaduna State High Court. When the case came up on Monday, the judge said the indefinite adjournment was as a result of his appointment as the judge in the Presidential and National Assembly Elections Petitions Tribunal in Yobe State. The Shiites leader and his wife, Zeenat, have been in detention since December 2015, following a clash between his followers and the Nigerian Army in Zaria, Kaduna State. Over 300 of his followers were killed during the incident. El-Zakzaky and his wife are standing trial over allegations of culpable homicide, unlawful assembly and disruption of public peace, among others. In an interview with journalists shortly after the adjournment, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), lead counsel to the defendants, said his clients were unable to appear in court because of their deteriorating health condition. He said since December 14, 2015 when they were detained, they had not been given adequate medical care, stressing that they were in urgent need of medical attention. “The court has adjourned sine die, meaning, indefinitely. “My clients are yet to access any form of medical attention even after the court had ordered so. “The case had to be adjourned, as my clients need time to attend to their health,” Falana said. Justice Kurada had, on January 22, 2019, ordered the Kaduna State Government to avail Zakzaky and his wife access to medical care.
