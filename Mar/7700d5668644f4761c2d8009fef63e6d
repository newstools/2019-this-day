Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has congratulated, Bala Mohammed, on his declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the Governor-elect of Bauchi state. Atiku, in a statement Tuesday by his media aide Paul Ibe, said PDP was now poised to bring progress to Bauchi through him and thereby extend the frontiers of democracy, peace, progress and prosperity, especially considering his sterling achievements as the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, wherein he made life a joy for those he was charged to administer. According to him, “Your victory is a deeply satisfying one. In you, the good people of Bauchi state have rightly reposed their confidence for four years of good governance”. Atiku noted that Mohammed’s efforts to provide potable water in the FCT remain unmatched today, adding that such would be replicated in Bauchi state.
