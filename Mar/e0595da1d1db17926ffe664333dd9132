World football ruling body FIFA confirmed yesterday that English Premier League (EPL) clubside Chelsea have appealed against the transfer ban imposed on them.
The ban was imposed after they were found guilty of breaching rules on overseas players under the age of 18. The London side, banned from the next two transfer windows and also fined 600,000 Swiss francs (456,135 pounds), had already said they would appeal against the decision. The decision was taken by FIFA’s disciplinary committee last month. FIFA said in a statement that it could not give a schedule for the process, nor say whether the ban would be lifted pending the appeal hearing. “Any decision on the sanction remaining in place during the appeal process is to be taken by the chairman of the FIFA Appeal Committee,” it said.
