Akwa United forward, Mfon Udoh and MFM FC’s Fidelis Ilechukwu have been named League Bloggers Awards (LBA) Player and Manager for the month of January respectively. Both men claimed the individual prizes for their outstanding outings in January with their clubs in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). Udoh came out tops ahead of Abdulrahman Bashir of Enyimba, Tasiu Lawal of Katsina United and Fuad Ekelojuoti of Sunshine Stars. The Akwa United man netted four goals and provided two assists in the month under review — meaning he was directly involved in six of his club’s 10 goals in February. MFM Head Coach Ilechukwu had to fend off serious competition from Akwa United’s Brazilian trainer Rafael Everton as well as Usman Abd’Allah of Enyimba and Ibrahim Musa of Kano Pillars. The race was narrowed down to Ilechukwu and Everton who led their teams to unbeaten outings in the month under review. However Ilechukwu claimed the manager’s prize for a flawless outing in which MFM won all four of their matches compared to Akwa United who won four and drew one having played an extra game more. Abd’Allah’s Enyimba finished February with three wins, a draw and a loss while Kano Pillars under Musa won three of their four matches, losing at Go Round at the start of last month. LBA’s next announcement for the player and manager’s nominees in March will be released in early April.
