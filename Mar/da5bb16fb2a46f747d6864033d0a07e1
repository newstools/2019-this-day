Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja A former national chairmanship of the Peoples Democratic Party, Prof. Taoheed Adedoja, has defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adedoja, in his letter of resignation, addressed to the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, dated March 29, 2019, said he was quitting the party in ‎national interest as a pan Nigerian. The resignation of former minister from the PDP has brought to four the number of national chairmanship aspirants that have dumped the party in recent times. Apart from former Governor of Ogun state, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, others include former Minister of Education, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, and former Governor of Oyo state, Senator Rashidi Ladoja. The letter read: “I am aligning with the All Progressives Congress, APC, at this period of Nigeria’s political dispensation to contribute my best to the needed unity of Nigeria, as dictated by my pan Nigerian experience, having built bridges of unity among various socio political groups in the country all through my life endeavours ‎both in private and public sectors. “I want to align with the Federal government of Nigeria to contribute to the good governance the country deserves for our people and for my followers across the country.” Adedoja was the governorship candidate of the defunct Action Congress (AC) in the 2007 elections in Oyo State when the party fielded former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as its Presidential candidate.
