A Niger Delta based Oil and Gas expert, Chief Sunny Onuesoke, has called for a legislative framework by the National Assembly for the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This, he said would make it a legal and enforceable commitment on the part of oil operators in host communities.
Onuesoke, who is the Chairman of DAS Energy Services Limited, Effurun, Delta State, made the call during a presentation at a seminar in Port-Harcourt, on Host communities relationship with oil operators. He said: “The fact that there is no legal backing for accessing CSR by host communities from oil operators, gives room for inadequate and lackadaisical implementation of CSR.” The oil and gas expert further opined that a legalised CSR in the country would ensure that the host community are entitled to such claims.
He said the position of such oil operators/CSR would help smoothen and oil the relationship between host communities and the oil operators in ensuring the continuous flow of input from both parties. “The environment of business operates an open system, therefore the relationship between oil operators and host communities ought to be a symbiotic mutual relationship that tends to benefit both parties,” he further asserted. Onuesoke, further called on the National Assembly to consider giving legislative backing to CSR implementation, thereby making it mandatory and compulsory for oil operators to make their policy priority for CSR implantation in their respective host communities. He argued that the need for the legalisation of CSR was paramount due to the heavy damage done to the environment of the host communities by oil operators.
“Nigeria can take an example from India which is the only country in the world with legislated CSR under the India companies Act 2013,” he said.
