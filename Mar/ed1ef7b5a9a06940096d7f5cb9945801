By Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Senate on Wednesday, in a rowdy session, condemned the massive use of the military during the recent general election held on February 23 and March 9 across the country. This was sequel to a motion titled ‘The militarisation of the Nigerian electoral process and the inconsistent application of electoral laws by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)’ moved by Senator Dino Melaye (Kogi West) and co-sponsored by seven other senators including Senate Leader Ahmad Lawn, Senator Biodun Olujimi and Senator Mao Ohuabunwa (Abia North). The motion had barely been seconded by the Senate Leader Lawan, when senators across political divides started shouting, trying to disrupt proceedings. The Senate President Bukola Saraki was however able to restore sanity at plenary after Olujimi and Ohuabunwa had contributed to the motion, urging the upper legislative chamber to take a firm decision on the matter. The Senate thereafter urged INEC to ensure the unrestricted and consistent application of all electoral laws without bias to a candidate or a party in all elections. It also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the recent amendment to the Electoral Act “to ensure a level playing field and and adoption of equal standards in our national elections for a strong and peaceful democracy in Nigeria”.
