It was a memorable match night of UEFA Champions League on Wednesday at the Cubana Hut & Grill as fans were treated to an exclusive viewing experience by international premium lager beer, Heineken as Liverpool FC secured passage into the quarter final phase of the competition over host, Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in Germany. Ahead of the draw ceremony which comes up this afternoon in Nyon, Switzerland, consumers at the unmissable match moments were delighted that all the four English Premiership clubs with massive fan bases in Nigeria are still in the last eight of the competition for the first time since 2008/09 season. Interestingly, after watching the proceedings from giant screens at the premium arena, the talking point was the domination of English clubs ahead of the Spanish giants Real Madrid (four times) and FC Barcelona that have dominated the scene since 2014. Football fans joined match conversations by sharing their half and full time match predictions and were rewarded with gifts provided by Heineken. While the two matches of the night saw the duo of Sadio Mane of Liverpool and Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona emerge as winners of their respective games, it was Chioma Nwosu who was the heroine of the night at the Cubana Lounge as she predicted correctly the match results and performed brilliantly during the fans engagement session at interval. “We are excited to share all the unmissable moments of the current season of the UEFA Champions League as we have always done since the 2005/06 season when Heineken established a partnership with UEFA with the sponsorship of the most glamorous club football competition in the world. “We look forward to continually bringing premium experiences to live as we take football viewing experience beyond the comprehension of passionate fans of the competition,” the Marketing Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc., Emmanuel Oriakhi, remarked. Oriakhi stressed that after the draw ceremony this afternoon, “UEFA Champions League fans in Nigeria can continue to look forward to enjoying premium experiences as provided by Heineken at different outlets up to the final match on 1st of June at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain.”
