Adamawa governor-elect, Alhaji Ahmadu Fintiri, has promised to implement the new minimum wage of N30,000 when approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. Fintiri, who emerged winner on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made the promise on Friday while speaking with newsmen in Yola. He defeated incumbent Governor Muhammadu Bindow of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and 28 other candidates in the just-concluded supplementary governorship election. He said: “I will give civil service priority attention and make it more effective. “As a matter of priority, I will be first to implement it, so that we don’t experience any workers’ strike,” Fintiri said. He also assured students that his administration would be committed to resuscitating scholarship scheme, youth empowerment and other programmes to move the state forward. “We are also going to pay WAEC and NECO fees for students to reduce burden on parents,” Fintiri said. He thanked the people of the state for electing him and promised not to disappoint them. “The people have given us their mandate and God has actualised it today. “We will ensure that we deliver on our campaign promises and manifesto to them. “We urge them to remain calm, law-abiding as they celebrate and wait for our swearing-in ceremony,” Fintiri said. Fintiri, a former Speaker of the state House of Assembly and acting governor, emerged winner scoring 376,552 votes to beat his closest rival, Governor Bindow who scored 336,386 votes. (NAN)
