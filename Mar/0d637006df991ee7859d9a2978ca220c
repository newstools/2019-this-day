Organisers of the Bankole Olumide Aluko (BOA) football competition for Lawyers in Lagos have scheduled the draw for this year’s edition to hold today at the Astroturf 2000 Ikoyi, Lagos. The competition features some of the biggest law firms in the country, who gather at the Astroturf 2000 on Sundays to display their soccer skills in memory of one of their late colleague, Bankole Olumide Aluko. The competition was pushed forward to avoid it clashing with the ongoing elections in the country. The organisers said in a statement yesterday that they were working round the clock to make this year’s tournament even more competitive and exciting for everyone, adding that certain regulations have been put in place to ensure a peaceful competition.

The teams are Perchstone and Graeys LP, Pinheiro LP, Aelex , Sofunde Osakwe, Ogundipe & Belgore/NICCOM LLP (merger), Punuka Attorney, Falana & Falana, Templars and Olisa Agbakoba Legal.
