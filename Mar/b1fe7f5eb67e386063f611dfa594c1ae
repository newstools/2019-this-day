Tecno Mobile has partnered WakaFire to organise the second edition of the WakaFire mobile photography masterclass at the just concluded Social Media Week (SMW). The masterclass session which was themed: ‘Leveraging Mobile Photography to Tell Compelling Stories’ was broadcast live to an international audience through a mobile phone. According to a statement made available to THISDAY by the Tecno Public Relations and Strategic Partnership Manager, Jesse Oguntimehin, it was noted that the panellists dissected engaging topics including branding, visual identity and storytelling and gave implausible tips on mobile photography, looping the experience Tecno mobile offers in every photographic journey to the simple yet intricate mix of flawless photography with your mobile phone. The statement also noted that the Creative Director of MOA Creative Design Studio, Modupe Oduyemi, advised participants on the need to tell a story, using the tools of visual identity, logo/symbols, colours, typography and images as related to storytelling in branding. In her words: “For you to tell a story, it means you’re a person people can listen to and ended by describing the tools of visual identity- logo/symbols, colours, typography and images as related to storytelling in branding.” The statement also noted that the Managing Director, Jonathan Cole, Osaretin Avbuleimen, discussed on branding and how it is different from business. Avbuleimen explained that having a business does not necessarily qualify a person as a brand owner. He also noted that to be a brand owner, one must have a brand manual and be able to tell a compelling story, “the DNA of any brand is the DNA of the founder or set of founders.” The statement added that a documentary photographer, Abdusalam Hamza, emphasized the significance of his Tecno phone in telling the stories of the subjects in his pictures.
