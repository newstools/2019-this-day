By Olaoluwakitan Babatunde In line with its core value of encouraging Nigerian youths to embrace agriculture, the World Farmers Centre is embarking on a project aimed at raising 1000 millionaire farmers within the space of five years. Speaking on the project in Lagos yesterday, the founder of Farmers’ Centre, Dr. Joseph Deji-Folutile, said the project would expose young Nigerian farmers  to the different areas of investment in the agric sector, in order to broaden their perspectives. According to him,  there is a huge tendency for people to concentrate on a few aspects of the farming industry  that are considered to be lucrative at the expense of other value chains that are equally important and which could yield better profits. “For over 10 years, we have had direct contacts with farmers in the country, trying to provide solutions to most of their technical problems. Through our monthly publication, the Farming Advice Digest, which is a specialized publication on farming, we have had robust  interactions with farmers at all levels, thus giving us the unique opportunities of understanding the gaps in the sector. The Farmers’ Centre is embarking on the training series as part of its contributions to the development of the agric sector in Nigeria as a whole,’’ Dr. Deji-Folutile explained. He added that farming remains a rich venture because it is a means through which food is made available to the people. “Everyone must eat.  This makes farming a viable venture. But farmers need to be rightly guided and trained to use the huge opportunities before them very well. “The 1,000 young Nigerian millionaire project will involve regular seminars, butt camps, farm visits, mentoring and it is appropriate for private and public organizations,” he added. The World Farmers’ Centre was founded in 2017 to help provide solutions to the problem of hunger in the country through knowledge transfer to the people involved in different aspects of farming.
