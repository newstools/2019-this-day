Thibaut Courtois’ father has accused the Madrid media of bullying his son following Real Madrid’s woeful performance against Ajax that saw them dumped out of the Champions League. Thierry Courtois believes the Spanish and Flemish press have ‘targeted’ his boy after he shipped four goals, including a Lasse Schone free kick, against the Eredivisie side last week at the Bernabeu. It’s not the first time the former Chelsea goalkeeper has faced criticism since joining Real last summer and his dad is refusing to keep quiet on the matter. ‘I feel that everyone is targeting Thibaut,’ Courtois’ father said. ‘The Spanish press, and also the Flemish. As a father, I cannot ignore that. ‘A goalkeeper is always the first target, it is part of the job. For right or wrong, I let you judge that. ‘But after the match against Ajax, he was targeted because of the fourth goal after he’d played well. This single mistake has taken on huge proportions. ‘There are also personal things that come out in the press. I see the intentions of journalists to my son. ‘I’m struggling with that, but luckily Thibaut is above that. He knows what to do and is aware of his qualities and he will not doubt himself.’ Courtois’ future at the club is also in doubt following Monday’s huge announcement that Zinedine Zidane has returned as manager. Zidane, who originally blocked Courtois’ move to the club during his first stint in charge, could reinstate Keylor Navas as his No 1 again having trusted the Costa Rican previously. Real paid Chelsea £35million for Courtois last summer but may ship him off should they receive a good enough offer for the Belgium international.
