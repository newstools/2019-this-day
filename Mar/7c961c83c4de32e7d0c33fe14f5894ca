The Final of the 9th edition of the Daniel Ogechi Akujobi Memorial (DOAM) Foundation Golf Tournament, featuring about 190 players is scheduled to tee off on Saturday, March 30, 2019 at the Golf Section of Ikoyi Club 1938 in Lagos, with several prizes at stake to be won courtesy of electronics giant, LG, and other sponsors. The Coordinator of the event, Mr. Pat Bassey, stated that: “As is usual for this special tournament, the Ikoyi Golf Course is being put in great but very challenging shape to ensure the emergence of a truly deserving 2019 Champion of the DOAM Foundation Charity Golf Tournament. With best-in-class golfing hospitality and mouthwatering prizes on offer, participating golfers are in for a special tournament day treat that has become the hallmark of this annual event.” Proceeds from this year’s tournament will enable the Foundation increase its Scholarship Roll to 60 students, boost its Back-to-School and Mentorship programmes, re-equip and refurbish an Accident and Trauma Centre, power various Medical Missions and Healthy Living (Health is Wealth) Enlightenment programmes, as well as expand its Empowerment (Skills Acquisition) initiatives. All of these initiatives are aimed at touching lives of our less privileged citizens. The event will be rounded off with a Closing Ceremony and Awards’ Cocktail later that evening, at which event the DOAM Foundation will show appreciation to those corporate organisations, groups, and individuals without whose support the Foundation’s impact would be severely limited. This year’s tournament is heavily backed by an impressive lineup of Individual and Corporate Donors/Sponsors including PricewaterhouseCoopers, Diamond Bank Plc, ARM Pension Managers, Radial Circle Group, Zenith Bank Plc, Providus Bank, Channels Television, Silverbird Television, Grand OAK, Cappa & D’Alberto, SPAR (Park N’ Shop), ExxonMobil, Fidelity Bank Plc, Victoria Crown Plaza, LG Electronics, Ikoyi Club 1938, Raddisson Hotel, and many more.
