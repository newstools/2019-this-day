Martins Ifijeh A total of 184 persons have enjoyed free dental and medical care at the Taiwo Afolabi Free Rural Dental Outreach, which was held at Dugbe market in Ibadan recently. The rural community health outreach, which is organised by the University of Ibadan Association of Dental Students, is a free medical mission targeted at rural communities in Oyo State and is sponsored by SIFAX Group. Some of the services the beneficiaries enjoyed were body mass index (BMI) measurement, blood pressure test, random blood glucose measurement, blood pressure measurement, dental clerking, examination and referrals, extractions and scaling and polishing. Medical personnel deployed for the event included doctors, medical and dental students from the University College Hospital, Ibadan. There was also a question and answer session, which was meant to educate the beneficiaries on how to improve their oral health. Mr. Olumuyiwa Akande, Corporate Affairs Manager, SIFAX Group, said the sponsorship of the programme was part of the humanitarian gestures of the company, adding that SIFAX Group believes that healthy citizens translate to a healthy nation. President, University of Ibadan Dental Students Association, Urenna Emenyonu, said the aim of the outreach was to create an oral health awareness and promotion of good oral health hygiene in the society. She noted that SIFAX Groupâ€™s support for the outreach has helped to not only reach out to many rural persons but also equipped the students with adequate field knowledge needed for them to excel in dentistry. She enjoined other corporate organisations to emulate the company by partnering the student body to take the rural health mission to other communities.
