By Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Kano State Deputy Governor, Alhaji Nasir Yusuf Gawuna, the Commissioner for Local Government, Murtala Sule-Garo, and the Chairman of Nasarawa Local Government, Alhaji Lamin Sani, were arrested in the early hours of Monday by the police for allegedly trying to disrupt the collation of the election results in Nassarawa Local Government Area of the state. The police are yet to respond to the arrest as at the time of filling this report, but sources close to the police in Kano confirmed that the police will issue a statement over the incident anytime from now. It is expected that Gawuna will be released after interrogation as he enjoys immunity from prosecution under the constitution as deputy governor. However, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has adjourned collation of the governorship election results of Nassarawa Local Government over the alleged attack on collation centre at about 1.30am on Monday. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Riskuwa Arab-Shehu, said this on Monday after the collation of results from 43 out of the 44 local government areas (LGAs) of the state. The INEC Commissioner said the suspension was necessary because of the security challenges the commission was having at Nassarawa LGA. According to the REC, the result was snatched from the collation centre, adding that the electoral body will refer to its primary and secondary data base to generate the result from polling units and wards. He also explained that INEC will generate the result, verify and consider those that are acceptable within the electoral law. Professor Riskuwa added that party agents would be invited for the verification of the results to ensure tranparancy during the regeneration of the results. Forty-three local government results had been released out of the 44 in the state and prior to the attack on the centre in the night, Nasarawa LGA result was the only being awaited for collation.
