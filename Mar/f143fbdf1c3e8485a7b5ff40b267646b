In celebrating  the 2019 World Oral Health Day, Oral B,  a  toothpaste brand of P&G Nigeria, has said that it would provide free dental care  service to  10million Nigerians,   through its Mobile Dental Clinic Programme. According to P&G Country Category Manager, Oral Care (West & East Africa), Tolu Pogoson,  the free service would run for a period of four years. Explaining the motive for the move, he said: “We are committed to improving the oral care of Nigerians, hence our drive to reach 10 million Nigerians, educating them on oral health and giving free dental checks through our Mobile Dental Clinic. We want to inspire individuals to take charge of their own oral health by taking specific actions to help prevent oral diseases and safeguard their overall health.” He  informed further  of the company’s  plans to  invest in enlightening Nigerians, with a view to equipping them with knowledge needed to aid early detection of diseases and best treatment options, amongst other areas. “Our efforts would be in educating consumers on the wider implications of protecting their oral health, helping them recognise that preventive care is always the best option. We would harp on early detection and treatment, which are crucial to ensuring the best outcomes against oral diseases and associated health complications”, he said. With the theme of the 2019 World Oral Health Day as  ‘Say Ahh: Act on Mouth Health’, Pogoson  called  on individuals, families and communities to take action to protect their oral health. “Poor oral health extends far beyond the mouth, with the possibility of taking a serious toll on an individual’s overall health and well-being.” “However, we  are confident that targeted actions can curb the prevalence of oral diseases. This is why it is important for us to continue to reach millions of Nigerians, give free dental checks and educate them on good  practices, for many years to come”, he stressed.
