By Amby Uneze in Owerri The agitation for Imo Charter of Equity was Friday ratified by the Imo State Advisory Council of Elders by adopting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Emeka Ihedioha, as the sole candidate to be voted as governor on March 9. The council, which comprises elders from Orlu, Okigwe and Owerri zones of the state, enjoined all Imo citizens to vote Ihedioha as the next governor because the council found the manifesto of the party more appropriate to recover the economy of the state. In a four-page communique signed by leaders of the council as well as its key conveners: Prof. Francis Dike (SAN) for Orlu zone, Engr. Charles Ugwu for Okigwe zone and Air Commodore Luke Ochulor (rtd) for Owerri zone said that the council consulted, interviewed and evaluated candidates from different registered political parties and their respective manifestoes and resolved to adopt Ihedioha.
