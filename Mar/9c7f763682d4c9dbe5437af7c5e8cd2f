Mountains of Fire and Miracles Ministries FC left-back, Jonathan Zikiye has said that his team is ready and fully prepared to give Lobi Stars a good fight for the three points ahead of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) Match-day 3 rescheduled fixture. The Makurdi-based team will host MFM in a rearranged Nigerian topflight fixture today at the Aper Aku Stadium. Both teams have met five times in the NPFL. MFM and the hosts won two games each and shared the spoils in their last meeting with a goalless draw. Zikiye disclosed in an interview minutes after his team’s work out session on Tuesday at the Aper Aku Stadium that the Olukoya Boys are ready to battle Lobi for the maximum points. “We came to Makurdi fully prepared though we know the capability of what Lobi Stars can do on the pitch, they just came from the continent I think they will come all out because they struggled in their last home match. I think they will want to see how they can bounce back with this game. “We are expecting a tough game as usual, we have respect for them but we are not banking on that, we have been training so hard ahead of the game and we are focused as well and there is a lot of concentration in our team. So I think we will give them a good run for the three points tomorrow,” Zikiye said. The Olukoya Boys are sitting comfortably on the NPFL Group A table with 18 points from eight games while Lobi Stars have seven points from five matches.
