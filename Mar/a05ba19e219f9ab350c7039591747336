Rerun election, according to the electoral umpire, will also be held in all polling units across the state where elections were cancelled. Announcing the outcome of the keenly-contested election at about 12:13 am, at the INEC state office in Bauchi, which served as state collation centre, the state Returning Officer, Professor Mohammed Kyari of the Federal University of Technology, Adamawa, stated that the election was inconclusive.
