Nigeria’s Under-19 national team, the ‘Junior Green Yellow’, has set one foot at the World Cup after upsetting tournament favourites, Uganda yesterday with 30 runs, to remain the only unbeaten team at the African Qualifiers in Windhoek, Namibia. Though Nigeria struggled in the opening stage of the game as the Junior Green Yellow lost 4 wickets in the opening 15 overs with just 14 runs on the board, Nigerian Captain, Sylvester Okpe and Samuel Mba partnership however secured a life saving 54 runs that eventually raised the tally to 110 before running all out at 48 overs. In all, Samuel Mba totalled a priceless 56 runs off 135 balls, supported by Sylvester Okpe with 26 runs as the best performer with the bat for Nigeria. At the resumption of the second innings, Uganda began on a flying start with 42 runs for the loss of 1 wicket in 12 overs. The Junior Yellow Greens however rose to the occasion with unmatched bowling attack. The team came to full swing when Taiwo Mohamed, Danladi Isaac and Abolarin Rasheed tore into the hearts of the Ugandan bating line up and shattered them into fragments of too many piece to put together. Uganda could only manage a total of 80 runs all out in 25.1 overs Mohamed Taiwo was named Man of the Match with a heroic statistics of 4 wickets for 26 runs in 8.1 overs. Nigeria won by 30 runs and goes straight to the top of the table with one hand firmly on the trophy. Nigeria faces Tanzania today in what is regarded as formality match; as Tanzania is at the bottom of the log having lost all three matches in the series so far. Should Nigeria win against Tanzania only Sierra Leone, who has also managed one win (against Tanzania) so far will be standing between the Nigerian team and the World Cup ticket on Saturday.
