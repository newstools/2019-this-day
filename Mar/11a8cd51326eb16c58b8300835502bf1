Singer-songwriter WurlD has released his highly-anticipated EP ‘Love is Contagious’ along with an EP commercial. The nine-track body of work features an upbeat blend of Nigerian juju and contemporary pop music, including WurlD’s previous hits ‘Paranoid’, ‘Show You Off’ and the massively successful ‘Contagious’. ‘Love is Contagious’ reeks of WurlD’s afro-fusion style that bridges the divide between traditional West African music and global music lovers. Born in Lagos, Nigerian-American singer and Universal Music artiste, Sadiq Onifade, popularly known as WurlD, began his career after moving to Atlanta, Georgia, US, for school where he first started recording his own original music. He graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science before getting a Master’s Degree in Information. He has worked with several renowned artistes such as Akon, B.O.B, Mario, Major Lazer, Sarz, and DJ Spinall. Speaking on the release of his EP, WurlD said: “Love is Contagious is a conversation about love, from the infatuation stage to drowning in the emotion to the commitment stage. This EP is something everyone can relate to at some point in their lives. It has always been my goal to add a different range to the conversation and ‘Love is Contagious’ does that, taking my fans and family on the journey a man goes through finding himself in love” Prior to its release date, the Fuji-pop singer shared the cover art and tracklist for the project, debuting his new single, ‘Wishes & Butterflies’, in the process.
