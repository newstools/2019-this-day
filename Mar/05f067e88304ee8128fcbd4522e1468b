Segun James Barely 48 hours to the governorship elections in the country, the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) Wednesday endorsed and adopted Mr. Babatunde Gbadamosi as its consensus governorship candidate for Lagos State. At a press conference addressed by the state Secretary, Oloye Gboyega Adenji, the group of 35 political parties insisted that after careful consideration and assessment of all the candidates jostling to become the state governor, it is convinced that Gbadamosi’s passion for a greater Lagos is second to none. Besides, Adeniji stressed that his manifesto and developmental strategies for the state is not only practical, but realistic. He said: “The outcome of the 2019 presidential election last month has confirmed the fears of Nigerians for the future unity and wellbeing of the country under the present crop of leaders. In appreciation of these fears, 35 political parties under the CUPP met and agreed to put resources together to ensure a break from the past 20 years. “To this end, we the members of the CUPP in Lagos State have determined to endorse Gbadamosi of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) as our consensus governorship candidate for the 2019 elections.” He said the issue of indigeneship that has become a case for debates in the state is unnecessary as those who ruled the state in the last 20 years are not necessarily from the state even though they are Yoruba. “It is not about Igbo or Yoruba, the issue is about Lagos. Indigeneship has never been a factor in the development of Lagos,” he added. Adeniyi, however, reiterated the election of Gbadamosi, “shall make him the first indigenous governor of the state in the past 20 years. We, therefore, urge every well-meaning eligible voter in Lagos State to vote for the ADP candidate, Gbadamosi, as the next governor of the state.”
