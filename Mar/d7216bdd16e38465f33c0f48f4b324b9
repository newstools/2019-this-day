By Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja Following media reports that the National Peace Committee held a meeting with the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, the meeting was called at the instance of Atiku, a source close to the former vice president claimed. A national daily had reported that former military Head of State, and Chairman of the committee, Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar; the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, Cardinal John Onaiyekan, and Rev. Fr Atta Barkindo held a meeting with Atiku. It was also reported that Atiku’s running mate, Peter Obi; Senate President Bukola Saraki; PDP Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus; Speaker, Yakubu Dogara; and other PDP leaders were also in attendance. The report added that the meeting was convened following Atiku’s decision to go to court to challenge President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory. However, a reliable source told THISDAY that the meeting had nothing to do with Atiku’s decision to challenge the result of the presidential election in court. According to the source, “I can confirm to you that the committee met with Atiku Abubakar, but it has nothing to do with his decision to go to court. The meeting was even called at his (Atiku) instance.”
