By Goddy Egene The Nigerian equities market extended its negative performance last week as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) declined further by 2.12 per cent to close at 31,827.24. Similarly, market capitalisation fell by same margin to close at N11.869 trillion. Last week’s decline was worse than the 0.61 per cent of the previous week. However, volume and value of shares improved as investors traded   1.752 billion shares worth N19.681 billion in 22,319 deals compared 1.481 billion shares valued at N17.647 billion that exchanged hands  the preceding week. Apart from the NSE ASI that declined,  all other indices finished lower with the exception of the NSE Insurance and NSE Industrial Goods indices which rose by 3.01 per cent  and 0.93 per cent respectively while the NSE ASeM index closed flat. Given the conclusion of the presidential elections, which reduced the political uncertainty, it was expected that the market would witness a positive performance last week. Also, the release of corporate earnings by firms for the year ended December 31, 2018, was expected to stimulate demand for stocks. But reverse was the case. According to some market operators, investors were not a hurry to return to the market despite the conclusion of presidential election. “Only investors whose focus is long-term will not put so much emphasis on political risk because they know the market would bounce back once a president is sworn in May,” a broker, Mr. Sam Oguntayo said. The current performance of the market does not come to many stakeholders as a surprise because they had projected that the market would stabilise and recover in the second half of the year. In her opinion, the Group Chief Executive Officer of Emerging Africa Capital Group, Mrs. Toyin Sanni, had said the general expectation was that the first half 2019 would be more of the same as last year because investors would adopt a wait-and- see approach due to the elections. “Investors will wait to see how the elections are accepted and confirm that there will be peace in the post-election period up till May 29, which will be the day the new government will be sworn into office,” she said. According to her, investors generally just want stability and peace, stressing that the parameters remain positive for Nigeria from a long-term perspective. “Nigeria remains an attractive because of its size, demographics because of the continued activities of SMEs which are the drivers of this economy, because of how we have embraced the digital economy as a people and a nation because we are still a resources rich country. “But investors would want to see that there is a stable government, there is peace and government is accepted by the people, investors will want to see they can expect the right economic policy and the policies will be implemented in a consistent manner,” she had explained. More companies announced their results last week, recommending dividends. Dangote Cement Plc and African Prudential Plc reported their results, declaring dividends of N16 and 50 kobo per share respectively. Dangote Cement Plc posted  a revenue of  N901.21 billion, with Nigerian operations accounting for N618.30 billion, representing an increase of 11.9 percent over N552.36 billion in 2017. Profit after tax stood at N390.32 billion, up from   N204.25 billion while earnings per share rose from N11.65 to N22.83. Commenting on the results, Group Chief Executive Officer, Dangote Cement, Joe Makoju, said: “This is a record financial performance by Dangote Cement, driven by a strong increase in our home market, Nigeria, despite heavy rains and uncertainties about the election. Although Pan-African volumes were unchanged in 2018, I am confident that we will see an increase in 2019, driven by higher volumes in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Congo and Sierra Leone. Now that we have gas turbines operating in Tanzania we will also see increased profitability in the Pan-Africa region and this will help to improve overall Group margins.” Market Turnover Meanwhile, a further analysis of the market turnover for the week showed that the Financial Services Industry remained the most traded, recording 1.377 billion shares valued at N11.311 billion traded in 14,180 deals.
