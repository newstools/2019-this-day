A win on Saturday for Nigeria against Sierra Leone will seal the fate of the ‘Junior Yellow Greens’ of Nigeria’s place at the 2020 Cricket World Cup. After returning unscathed for the fourth straight time against Tanzania yesterday with a huge 151 runs, the sole World Cup ticket is there for Nigeria to pick.
