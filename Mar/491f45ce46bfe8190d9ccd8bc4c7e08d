As part of its continued international expansion strategy, the FXTM has announced that it has added another licence to its growing portfolio of regulated entities with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of the Republic of Mauritius. “FXTM holds the continual offering of excellent trading conditions at the heart of its values and the company is thrilled that this development represents another milestone in its international growth strategy, while also emphasising the brand’s commitment to operating to the highest regulatory standards,” the firm explained in a statement. It added: “In order to continue delivering the highest possible standard of service to its customers, FXTM not only constantly re-evaluates its product and service offerings, but also the jurisdictions under which it operates.
“Mauritius is fast becoming an internationally recognised Financial Supervisor with a strong legal framework, providing protection to the public in non-banking financial products. “The FXTM brand is also regulated through the FCA, CySEC and the FSCA which are amongst the most stringently regulated financial authorities.”
It noted that international customers would now have the opportunity to receive services through Mauritius. Clients will continue to enjoy the same great service they have come to expect from FXTM.
