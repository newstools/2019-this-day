The Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria (APWEN), in partnership with Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), will on March 30, host the 6th edition (for North Central Zone) of the ‘Invent It, Build It’, a girl-child educational initiative, at the LEA Primary School Ofugo Ankpa, Kogi, North Central
The programme will be in honour of the President of the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), Mr. Kashim Ali, who has been described as an enigma, a role model, an engineering icon and one of the best in the engineering profession. The President of APWEN, Mrs. Felicia Agubata in a statement, said the overreaching objective of the programme is to ignite passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in young girls and to showcase the socio-economic value and application of engineering in everyday life. “The target group is girls aged 8-10 years (classes 5 and 6) in the upper primary school in Nigeria. APWEN’s Invent It, Build It programme has been hosted in the five geo political zones in the country with the maiden edition held in Misau, Bauchi State in April 2018.” During the programme, she said experiments will be performed by the pupils with guidance by APWEN members along with an interactive/sensitisation session for parents, guardians and teachers to inspire positive attitude and support for females in the pursuit of STEM. “APWEN is confident that early contact with the target group will indeed spark off a desire and an ambition of the girl-child to study the sciences and ultimately pursue engineering as a profession. As the girls begin to imagine great careers in engineering and diligently demonstrate passion and with the right guidance, the sky will be their limit. APWEN’s role is to mentor, point the way forward and partner with the would be champions to midwife their careers by way of providing learning aids, seminars, scholarships at some points and above all inspiration,” Agubata said.
