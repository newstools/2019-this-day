Okpuzor Ezekiel As part of efforts to address the issues of domestic violence and sexual molestation in the society, the Justice Development and Peace Commission (JDPC) has organised a seminar with a focus to provide possible solutions. Speaking at the event in the weekend in Lagos, the head of JDPC, Lauretta Egboh, said that to eradicate domestic violence and sexual molestation in the society, adding that there is need for concerted efforts from parents, and Churches. “Whenever we glance through our newspaper and tune on our television we keep hearing and reading about domestic violence and sexual molestation, so JDPC took it upon themselves to address this issue because it can lead to more damages in the future”. She also noted that parents must love their children and be able to listen to them, urging parents to create friendliness with their children, “so that the children can pour out their mind all time.” In her remarks, the President, Women Arise for Change Initiative, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, said that the government must not relent in its fight to abusers. Joe said a lot of young people suffer molestation and most of their abusers are usually in a closed relationship with the abused. “The abused must speak up because a justice delayed is a justice denied, there is a constitution that guards every citizen and abusers would be brought to book,” she noted. The Nollywood actress, Gloria Young, noted that she has been appealing to the federal government to invest and support a particular story about physical and verbal abuse. Gloria said: “Nollywood has been doing a whole lot by fighting domestic violence and sexual molestation, but a lot need to be done, nollywood stories are becoming monotonous. What we just need is federal government grant or some big NGOs that will pick a particular story and go round nationwide, just the way they created awareness about HIV and AID.”
