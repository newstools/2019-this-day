The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has launched the reportgov.ng app, an official public service feedback and complaints platform to support business climate reforms implemented by the council since 2016. The platform, which is also a website, is also expected to facilitate the escalation and resolution of issues encountered with ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) towards ensuring a more business-friendly environment.
According to a statement, the app was co-launched by the Minister, Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okey Enelamah; Chairman, Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria, Mr. Adedotun Sulaiman, and Senior Special Adviser to the President on Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr Jumoke Oduwole, at the Regulatory Conversations (RC3.0) event themed “Improving Transparency and Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria.” The program featured a panel of discussants and stakeholders from the public, private sector and civil society, with a focus on issues bordering on transparency and efficiency of service delivery in Nigeria. The PEBEC was established in July 2016 to remove delays and restrictions that come with doing business in Nigeria, and make the country an easier place to start and grow a business. Supported by Executive Order 001 (EO1) signed in 2017 to promote transparency and efficiency in the business environment, PEBEC has undertaken to drive EO1’s six directives, which aim to address specific limitations identified in the civil and public service systems.
The new mobile app is available on the Google Play store, and, “is coming soon to the iOS store to enable users give feedback or complaint that will drive continuous improvement in service delivery and public protection efforts.”
