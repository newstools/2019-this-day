Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja As the battle to reclaim his mandate begins, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has inaugurated his legal team to challenge the result of the 23 February presidential election. The Independent National Electoral Commission had on Wednesday declared Muhammadu Buhari winner of the election. But Atiku had on Thursday rejected the result citing several malpractices including the use of the military to perfect voters’ intimidation and suppression in PDP strongholds, connivance of INEC officials, security agents and the ruling party to manufacture bogus figures and outright falsification of the returns from the polling units. Atiku in a statement Saturday by his media aide, Mr. Paul Ibe, revealed that the legal team would be headed by Dr. Livy Uzoukwu, (SAN) He stated, “I have just inaugurated my legal team and charged them with the responsibility of ensuring that our stolen mandate is retrieved”, Atiku said.
“I am encouraged by the presence of fearless men and women of the Bench. The judiciary which had in the past discharged itself ably is once again being called upon to deliver judgement on this matter that will be untainted by lucre and uncowed by the threat of immoral power”, he added
Atiku assured Nigerians that sooner than later these noble dispensers of justice would give a judgement that will represent a historic denunciation of electoral fraud and mandate bandit.
