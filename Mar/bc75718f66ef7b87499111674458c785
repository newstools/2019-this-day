Mary Nnah Maritels Industries Limited, makers of Funq Yue seasoning, recently rewarded loyal customers to mark the 10th anniversary of its product launch in Nigeria. In a ceremony held in Oke Arin market in Lagos Island and trade fair market were standby prizes of tricycle (keke Marwa) deep freezers, electric fan, mini buses and the grand prize of a Toyota corolla car, customers smiled home. Isaac Essien, General Manager, Maritels Industries Limited, said the event was aimed at rewarding their loyal customers, as the company marked its 10th anniversary. “Last year we ran a promo in commemoration of the anniversary. We slated today for the presentation. Today, we are here to keep our promises,” Essien said. He said that a good number of customers participated in the promo, which qualified them for the prizes of corolla car, mini buses and tricycles. He noted that same ceremony and gift items took place in the South-east and South-south zones few days before shifting to Lagos to appreciate their loyal customers in the South-east and South-south zones. Okpala Francisca, CEO, Maxfranc International, Trade Fair Complex and winner of the grand prize said her joy knew no bounds. “I am highly excited. It was not easy but for the grace of God, I sensed that I would make it. On December 23, we had a ghastly motor accident on Lagos or Ibadan expressway, it was really serious but to God be the glory, we all survived. Today, God has rewarded me with a beautiful car”. Enendu Maduka Eugene, another winner and CEO of Nobleman Ventures Oke Arin market was highly elated as he got a reward of a mini bus at the ceremony held a day before the trade fair presentation.
