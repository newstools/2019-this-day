The remains of the Emir, who reportedly died in Abuja on Tuesday night after a brief illness, we’re buried on Wednesday . In a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday, the Minister condoled with the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, the government and people of Kwara and, in particular, the people of Patigi over the
loss. The minister described the late Emir, who was the Vice Chairman of the State’s Traditional Council, as a man of peace, a great custodian of his people’s culture and a father to all. He said his wise counsel and leadership would be greatly missed, especially at this critical time in the history of Kwara State. Mohammed said his last meeting with the Emir, during the burial of the father of Olofa of Offa, left him with a good memory of the departed monarch. He prayed that God will grant the late Emir Al-Jannah Firdaus and comfort the people he left behind.
