The Sahara Group and The Dorcas Cancer Foundation have joined forces to increase awareness of the cancer scourge in a bid to reinforce the role early detection plays in preventing avoidable morbidity and mortality from the disease which claimed the lives of 9.6 million people in 2018. Statistics sourced from the World Cancer Day website indicates that at least a third of common cancers are preventable and up to 3.7 million lives could be saved each year through implementing appropriate strategies for prevention, early detection and treatment. Tagged ‘How Pink Is Your Love’, the project will take advantage of the euphoria surrounding the 2019 Valentine’s Day celebration to shore up awareness and early detection campaigns through youth engagement talks in schools, health walks, media interactions and donations to select cancer based non-governmental organisations. The campaign would be implemented across the energy conglomerate’s locations across Africa, Europe, Middle East and Asia.
Dr. Adedayo Joseph, Clinical Radiation Oncologist and Executive Director of Dorcas Cancer Foundation would provide lead technical support for the campaign through her organisation which is widely regarded for its leading role in stamping out cancer. “Last year, Sahara Group added more fillip to the issue of climate change on Valentine’s Day. Our ‘Greenest Love of All’ campaign was well-received and generated remarkable awareness and commitment to galvanising action towards protecting our environment. “This year, we are delighted to work with the reputable Dorcas Cancer Foundation to stem the tide of cancer, a deadly disease which can be tackled by awareness, early detection, accurate diagnosis, as well as prompt and proper treatment.” The Head of Corporate Communications at Sahara Group, Bethel Obioma explained.
