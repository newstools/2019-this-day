Anthony Joshua‘s heavyweight world title fight with Jarrell Miller has broken the Madison Square Garden record for highest-grossing pre-sale of a boxing event, though the arena did not reveal the figure. Joshua will defend his WBA Super, IBF, WBO and IBO crowns against Miller on June 1 in New York, with the fight being broadcast live on DAZN in the US and on Sky Sports Box Office in the UK. Tickets go on general sale on StubHub at midday on Tuesday, February 19 following today’s pre-sale for Match-room Fight Pass members, and fans hoping to get the chance to see Joshua lock horns with the ‘Big Baby’ will need to move quickly to purchase tickets. Tickets range from £80 to just under £2,000. ‘We know that AJ is a huge box office hit in the UK but to break the pre-sale record at the iconic Madison Square Garden is astounding,’ said promoter Eddie Hearn. ‘We are building a huge event on June 1 and we look forward to the all the build-up beginning with next Tuesdays press conference in New York.’ ‘We are thrilled with the early excitement for tickets,’ said Joel Fisher, executive vice president, MSG Marquee Events.. ‘Anthony Joshua versus Jarrell Miller will be an epic event at Madison Square Garden and we encourage fans to purchase tickets now because this fight will sell out.’
