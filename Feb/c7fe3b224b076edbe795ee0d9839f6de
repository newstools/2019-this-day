Cristiano Ronaldo was singled out by Atletico Madrid fans on Wednesday as Juventus lost 2-0 in the Champions League last 16 but the former Real Madrid forward was quick to point out his stellar record in the competition. “I won five Champions Leagues and these guys zero,” Ronaldo told reporters after the game, holding up his hand in the shape of a ‘zero’ to drive home his point. The Portuguese forward was jeered throughout the match at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, where Atletico got late goals from Uruguayan defenders Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin to take a vital lead into the return leg on 12 March. He responded to the taunts by holding up five fingers to indicate the number of times he had won the competition, four times with arch-rivals Real and once with Manchester United. Atletico have reached the final of Europe’s elite club competition three times but never lifted the trophy. They lost to Ronaldo’s Real Madrid in 2014 and 2016.
