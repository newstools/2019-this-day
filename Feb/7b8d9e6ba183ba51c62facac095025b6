By Goddy Egene The Nigerian stock market ended last week with a decline of  2.5 per cent  as investors locked in profits recorded the previous weeks.  The market had made an unexpected recovery, recording gains in two consecutive weeks. However, realising the high level of gains so recorded, some investors moved to take profit last week.  This development led a decline of 2.5 per cent in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index to close at 30,636.36, while market capitalisation shed N294.7 billion to be at N11.424 trillion. Similarly, all other indices finished lower with the exception of the NSE Oil/Gas Index that rose by 0.05 per cent. The industrial Goods index declined the most, going down by  3.7 per cent. The NSE Consumer Goods Index trailed with 3.4 per cent, while the NSE Banking Index dipped by 2.5 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index shed 2.2 per cent. But while the Nigerian market declined last week, advanced markets rallied following the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) decision to hold the Fed Funds rate in the target range of 2.25 per cent  ‐ 2.50 per cent, while also guiding to a slower pace of policy normalisation. The FOMC noted that it would be patient and that decisions to further hike rates would be data dependent, although this is contrary to indicators which show higher productivity, rebounding investment and surging growth. Also, markets were supported by fresh optimism given the resumption of United States(US). – China trade talks, as both cited substantial progress in two days of high-level talks. As a result, the performance in developed markets was largely bullish. In the US markets, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ closed the week higher, up 1.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, while UK FTSE rose 2.3 per cent. In the same vein,   France’s CAC 40,  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (1.3% W-o-W) and Japan’s Nikkei 225  (0.1% W-o-W) advanced by 1.5 per cent, 1.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent in that order. Across the BRICS countries markets, performances were generally positive as four of the five  indexes trended northwards. Russia’s RTS index recorded the largest gain of  1.7 per cent  followed by India’s BSE Sens, China’s Shanghai Composite, and South Africa’s FTSE/JSE All Share indexes which added  1.5 per cent,  0.6 per cent and 0.2 per cent in that order. Conversely, Brazil’s Ibovespa fell by 0.3 per cent. In Africa, performance was mixed as three of the six markets tracked   recorded gains. Egypt’s EGX30 recorded the largest gain, up 4.6 per cent, followed by Kenya’s NSE-20 that appreciated by 1.7 per cent.  Morocco’s Casablanca MASI garnered 0.4 per cent. On the flip side, the largest loss was recorded by Nigeria’s All-Share Index, Ghana’s GSE Composite and the Mauritius SEMDEX index trailed, falling by 0.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively. In Asia and the Middle East, performances were largely bearish as all five  markets recorded losses.
