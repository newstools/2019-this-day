Nigeriaâ€™s Two-time Commonwealth champion Odunayo Adekuoroye (57kg) spectacularly won a gold medal at the just-concluded Grand Prix of Germany in Dormagen, with eight-time African champion Blessing Oborududu claiming a bronze medal at the ranking event. Adekuoroye, a World Championship silver-medalist in 2017, impressively dismantled Szell Anna of Hungary 10-0 (via technical superiority) in the final to boost her ranking in global wrestling. On her way to the final, the multiple African champion recorded knockout wins (10-0) against Winchester Jacarra (USA) and Galambos Ramona in the quarter and semi finals respectively. Meanwhile, after losing 7-1 to Lappage Danielle in the earlier round, Oborududu, a reigning Commonwealth champion, recovered to claim the bronze medal in the 68kg class with a technical superiority (10-0) win against Seimaier Maria of Germany. However, the other Nigerian at the event, Aminat Adeniyi (62kg) failed in her attempt to win a medal at the tournament. The team, led by National Female Coach, Purity Akuh, will now shift attention to the Dan Kolov-Nikola Petrov ranking series tournament in Ruse, Bulgaria which runs from 28 February to 3 March.
