Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja Former United States President Bill Clinton Wednesday night made a telephone call to President Muhammadu Buhari, apologising for his inability to visit Nigeria on Wednesday as earlier scheduled. Clinton had been scheduled to visit Nigeria and witness the signing of peace accord by presidential candidates in Abuja on Wednesday, but ended up cancelling the planned trip, saying it could be misconstrued.
He was also expected to meet with Buhari and the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, ahead of tomorrow’s presidential poll.
But Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement, said the president, during Clinton’s telephone call, thanked the US president, describing him as a friend of the country and commended him for what he described as his constant support for the peace, stability and progress of Nigeria under a democratic dispensation. “President Buhari also assured him of his commitment to free, fair and credible elections in the weeks ahead. “President Clinton, who regretted his inability to visit the country to witness the signing of the final peace accord before the general election, wished Nigeria well as her citizens go to the polls,” the statement added.
