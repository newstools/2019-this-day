It said it was in posession of confidential report by the foreign elections strategists/consultants that recommended that the PDP take “urgent steps to rectify its poor electoral standing. “At the PDP’s strategy meeting held a few hours ago, the opposition party resolved to monetarily induce major actors and institutions in the electoral process with a view to compromising them ahead of the elections. “In this regard, the main opposition party has perfected plans to share money to persons and actors considered critical to the success of the elections,” it said. APC said PDP has also perfected plans to distribute between $5 million and $10 million to the states for “logistics and mobilisation” on election day. It said PDP is targeting INEC officials, security agencies and observers to make them agreeable to their rigging plots and other evil machinations “The PDP is also using faceless bloggers to attack frontline security agencies in the social media as part of their plan to discredit the agencies,” it said.
