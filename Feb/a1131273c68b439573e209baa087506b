History seems to be repeating itself. Yes, the New England Patriots won another Super Bowl, but Tom Brady was once again looking for his jersey after the Big Dance. The Patriots quarterback, 41, had his jersey stolen two years ago in Houston following a dramatic comeback against the Atlanta Falcons. And after the 13-3 victory over the LA Rams, Brady was recorded in a pulsating Patriots locker room searching for the missing garment. Asked by a journalist if he knew where his famous No 12 jersey was, Brady replied: ‘I gotta find that out.’ Two years ago at Houston’s NRG Stadium Mexican journalist Martin Mauricio Ortega reportedly pilfered the attire. He also allegedly stole Brady’s game-winning jersey from Super Bowl XLIX and the helmet of Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller in San Francisco. US police forces recovered the items in Mexico in 2017. As a result, security to the locker rooms has been tightened, with many media unable to access after the NFL’s annual showpiece. Following the game, Brady said: ‘I can’t believe it – what a year. ‘Our defense played unbelievable and we finally had a touchdown drive in the fourth quarter. ‘It took us a while but you’ve got to grind it out and find a way.’ On winning his sixth Super Bowl, Brady added: ‘It probably won’t sink in for a very, very long time. ‘I’m just so blessed to play with the best team-mates through the years from our 2001 team and all the way through to now – I love these guys.’
