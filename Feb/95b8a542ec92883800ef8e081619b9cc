By Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja The Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, Thursday met with the service chiefs in his office at the Presidential Villa behind closed doors. It was suspected that the meeting, which lasted for almost an hour, might border on security situation in the country during the election period. However, the service chiefs’ meeting with the chief of staff generated interest as the heads of the military traditionally report only to the president who is the commander-in-chief of armed forces. It was learnt that the four men had initially gone to the office of the aide-de-camp (ADC) to President Muhammadu Buhari before proceeding to Kyari’s office. The four service chiefs who were in the meeting were the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin; Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas; and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar. After the meeting, the chief of staff took his file and headed for the president’s office.
