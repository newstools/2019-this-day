By Bamidele Famoofo The Fixed Income and Currency (FIC) market on the platform of the FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange has recorded its biggest drop in turnover (month-on-month) in four years as at the end of January 2019. Turnover, according to figures made available by FMDQ OTC, registered a 14.85 percent or N2.63trillion decrease in the first month of business activities in 2019. It was the first time in the history of the market when value will record such a magnitude of drop. Effort to get an explanation for the unprecedented turnover drop from the company proved abortive as at the time of press as officials contacted on phone declined comments saying they were not in the position to explain the performance. Meanwhile, THISDAY investigation revealed that the closest to the drop recorded in January 2019 was in 2017 when turnover dropped by 13.09 per cent or N1.65trillion. History has also shown that it is the culture in the FIC market for investment activities to start lower than it ended the previous year. Record shows that turnover of transactions carried out in the FIC for the month of January 2016 settled at N7.35trillion; a N80.23billion (1.08 per cent ) decrease over the value recorded in December 2015. In the same manner, turnover of transactions carried out in the FIC market for the month of January 2017 amounted to N10.65trillion; a 13.09 per cent N1.65trillion reduction while for the month of January 2018, turnover amounted to N11.71trillion; a 1.28 per cent decrease (N0.15trillion) from the value recorded in December 2017. Howbeit, on year-on-year basis, turnover in the last four years have recorded an appreciation except in 2016 when it recorded a 33.56 per cent or N3.71trillion drop. Year-on-year, turnover increased by 28.78 per cent or N3.37trillion as at January 2019. Breakdown of investment activities in the market in January 2019 showed that the Treasury Bills (T. bills) and Foreign Exchange (FX) market segments remained the major drivers of turnover in the FIC market, jointly accounting for 78.69per cent of turnover in January and higher by 2.21 percentage points from their contribution to turnover in December (76.48 per cent). Total FX market turnover in January 2019 was $14.91billion, representing a 35.36 per cent ($3.89billion) MoM increase from the turnover recorded in December 2018 ($11.01billion). According to FMDQ, “The increase in FX turnover in January can be attributed to the 150.61 per cent and 0.61 per cent rise in Member-Clients and Inter-Member trades which was only marginally offset by the 27.55 per cent decrease in Member-CBN3 trades.” “Contrastingly, turnover at the Investors & Exporters (I&E) FX Window in January 2019 recorded 22.42 per cent ($1.11billion) and 26.86 per cent ($1.41billion) MoM and YoY decreases respectively to close at $3.84billion from the $4.95billion and $5.25billion recorded in December and January 2018 respectively,” FMDQ explained. Analysis of FX turnover by product type showed that FX Spot was the main driver of the overall increase in FX turnover, with a MoM increase of 462.93 per cent ($7.84billion). FMDQ disclosed that the increase in FX Spot could be attributed to FX inflow for investments in the higher yielding FGN5 fixed income securities. Conversely, FX Derivatives recorded a MoM decrease of 42.34 per cent ($3.95bn), driven mainly by a 44.89 per cent decline in Member-CBN FX Swaps turnover, while turnover in FX Futures also declined by 35.66 per cent .
