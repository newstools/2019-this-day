Expectedly, the restoration of power to Ode Aye attracted the commendation of the traditional, Oba William Akinmusayo Akinlade, who thanked the staff and management of BEDC for taking the community out of darkness. This restoration was made possible because BEDC management, led by the Chief State Head, Ondo/Ekiti states, Mrs. Kunbi Labiyi, had charged the field staff to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that Ode-Aye people enjoyed electricity beginning from the 2018 Christmas. Another factor that played in was the charge by the Ondo State Governor, through his Technical Committee on Power that everything must be done to end the unacceptable darkness that had enveloped the region in the past 12 years. Also, BEDC during a meeting with the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, had assured that power would be restored before December end given the numerous tourist destinations the state boasts of, which includes; Ipole-Iloro, Ariata Waterfalls in Ipole-Iloro andÂ  Ikogosi Warm Spring Resort. At that meeting, the Managing Director/CEO, BEDC, Mrs. Funke Osibodu, had hinted of the ongoing rehabilitation of Ikogosi/Erinijiyan/Ipole-Iloro line on the Aramoko 33kv feeder, adding that communities in these areas would have more stable power soon. It is imperative to state that at the moment, BEDC is presently partnering the Ekiti State Government for a more improved supply to enable it power its streetlights for about 10 hours daily, against the present three hours situation.
