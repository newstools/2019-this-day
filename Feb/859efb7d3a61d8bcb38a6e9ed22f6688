Citing the robust liquidity in the system, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had disclosed that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of commercial banks improved from 10.79 per cent as at August 2018, to 15.26 per cent as of December 2018. The development was attributed to the recent promissory notes issued by the federal government to settle contractor debts. Also, the liquidity ratios, return on asset and return on equity have remained robust. CAR is a measurement of a bank’s available capital expressed as a percentage of its risk-weighted credit exposures.
The CBN requires that banks with international subsidiaries maintain CAR of 15 per cent, while banks without international subsidiaries maintain CAR of 10 per cent. But the minimum requirement for the systemically important banks is 16 per cent. The central bank was also planning to introduce new capital rules in the second quarter of 2019 that would be stricter about what sort of funding qualifies as capital. The rules, which will align the banking industry with the international accord known as Basel III, also require lenders to create buffers that should help them in the case of a crisis. According to CBN’s Deputy Governor, Financial System Stability Directorate, Mrs. Aishah Ahmad: “Data provided by bank staff showed that the industry capital adequacy ratio increased considerably from 10.23 per cent in December 2017 to 15.26 per cent in December 2018. “The improvement in capital buffers is a positive development, which will be critical should a downward trend in crude oil prices manifest given banks’ portfolio concentrations in the oil and gas sector.”
