iSON BPO, Africa’s leading customer experience provider with presence in 14 countries in Africa, has inaugurated the first iSON female football team in Nigeria – Abeokuta centre. . The initiative serves as a discovery platform in which talents are groomed. It is also designed to groom the future Nigerian Female Football Stars. The inaugural match which was played in Abeokuta, Ogun State, was organized by the company’s inbound and outbound teams. The club was setup strictly for employees and has helped in improving employee engagement which also helps in improving job satisfaction amongst staff members, and portrays iSON as an advocate in women empowerment. iSON BPO’s Group CEO, Pravin Kumar, in expressing his delight said “We are very proud to launch the first iSON female football team. We believe this is a step in the right direction in the advocacy for women empowerment. It is truly memorable inventiveness for us, as others are now following in our footsteps. It is a moment of pride for us and was an important occasion, as we now have a female football team”. One of the key rationales behind the initiative is to reduce youthful exuberance and ensure that the female team can match their male counterpart in the sports arena. The team is ready to meet any female football team to further test their might.
