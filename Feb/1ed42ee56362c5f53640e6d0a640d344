 Nigeria’s Super Falcons lost 4-1 to Austria in the opening match of the Cyprus Invitational Tournament yesterday at the AEK Arena,  Larnaca. The reigning African champions had the misfortune of playing one player down following the sending away of goalkeeper Tochukwu Oluehi in the fifth minute for handling the ball outside the box. Despite that initial setback, Falcons were able to resist the Austrians for the first 45 minutes. But that resistance cave in in the second half for them to concede four goals in that half. Tor Nina Burger gave the Austrians the lead three minutes after the break as the Europeans finally make their numerical advantage count. They pilled more pressure on the Falcons and doubled their lead through Nicole Billa  a minute before the hour mark. Barcelona Ladies of Spain star Asisat Oshoala reduced the deficit for Nigeria firing home Anan Imo cross in the 65th minute. Laura Feiersinge restored Austria’s two-goal lead  when she scored off a fine corner kick from Elisabeth Mayr in the 72nd minute. Jennifer Klein extended Dominik Thalhammer’s  side lead eight minutes from time when  she scored  her first international goal through an assist from Elisabeth Mayr. In the group’s other fixture, Belgium defeated Slovakia 3-0 in a one sided game.  The Super Falcons will face Slovakia in their next game in the competition on Friday.
