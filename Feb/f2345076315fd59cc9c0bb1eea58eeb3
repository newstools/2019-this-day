Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) record scorer in a season, Mfon Udoh, has revealed there is heightened competition amongst players for the prestigious Eunisell Boot Award to be presented to the highest goal scorer, at the end of the 2019 season. Eunisell instituted the award in 2018, with each goal worth N200,000 “The financial incentive attached to Eunisell Boot is a fortune. Every striker in the NPFL is eyeing the money. In fact, it has made the striking role more competitive,” Udoh, who plays for Akwa United stated yesterday. In addition, he said: “The Eunisell Boot has improved performance in the NPFL, especially for strikers. Players and teams are focused on winning.” The Nigerian International has rediscovered his midas touch since returning to Akwa United and tops the race for the Eunisell Boot with six goals so far. Back in 2014, he entered the history books as the first player to score a record 23 goals in a season. Junior Lokosa, now with Esperance Sportive, in Tunisia, was the Eunisell Boot inaugural winner after scoring 19 goals in 2018 for Kano Pillars.
