Due to an increase in demand, the A-Class is for the first time also offered as a sedan. This follows up the successful launch of the new A-Class last year that pushed boundaries in major markets. The A-Class Sedan comes with a modern and superior sporty design, an unrivalled experience with MBUX, Intelligent Drive functions from the S-Class, a completely redefined interior design and optional equipment and appointments like keyless-go with hands-free access.

The side mirrors sit on the beltline, while the 16 to 19-inch wheels and the pronounced wheel arches give the A-Class Sedan a sporty stance on the road. On the rear end there are two-part tail lamps that emphasizes width, the rear reflectors have been relocated to the modular two-part rear bumper and depending on the selected equipment, this rear bumper is available with a black diffuser or with chrome trim strip and chrome tailpipe tips. The Multibeam LED headlamps are another highlight, they allow extremely quick and precise, electronically controlled adjustment of the headlamps to suit the current traffic situation. Each headlamp features 18 individually actuated LEDs. The inside of the A-Class Sedan comes in a modern and avant-garde look emphasising a revolution from within. The dashboard gets a completely new and avant-garde design, with a cowl above the cockpit and the wing-shaped main body of the dashboard extending from one front door to the other with no visual discontinuity. Also the optional Widescreen display is completely free-standing and the air vents come in a sporty turbine look. An optional equipment is the ambient lighting with 64 colours, it comes with even more variety as well as an emotive presence. The A-Class Sedan also highlights spaciousness as a key feature of its interior offering great utility. This includes above-average shoulder, elbow and headroom plus the easy access to the rear. It is at the top of its segment with regard to rear headroom (944 mm). The boot holds 420 litres and was designed for practical usability.

The A-Class Sedan has been introduced to the market with the A200 petrol engine. It comes with a 1.3 liter M282 engine producing a power output of 120 kW (163 hp) and a torque of 250 Nm. Power is transmitted by the 7G-DCT dual-clutch transmission, this system is an automated three-shaft manual transmission consisting of two subtransmissions, each with its own clutch. This allows a particularly comfortable but nevertheless dynamic mode of driving. The A-Class Sedan keeps up the pace with technology from the A-Class, the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) comes as a standard equipment.

The Intelligent drive system is another technological innovation in the A-Class Sedan. This comes with the very latest driving assistance systems with cooperative driver support, and thus provides the highest level of active safety in this segment with functions adopted from the S‑Class. For instance, the Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is able to provide route-based support to the driver in numerous situations, and to predictively and conveniently adjust the speed when approaching bends, junctions or roundabouts. While the expanded Active Brake Assist can effectively help to mitigate the consequences of rear-end collisions with slower-moving, stopping or stationary vehicles ahead. Another highlight is PRE-SAFE PLUS, which can recognise an imminent rear-end collision. If the danger of a collision persists, the system can also firmly apply the brakes of the stationary vehicle, thus minimising the risk of injuries by reducing the forward jolt caused by an impact from the rear.
