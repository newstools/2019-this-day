The non-oil sector remains the key driver of the growth, accounting for about 91percent of the real GDP growth, reports Bamidele Famoofo There are indications that Nigeria can drive the growth of its economy with little or no reliance on revenue from oil. The facts emerged from figures released from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) about the performance of the GDP as at end of April 2019. According to the bureau, the GDP as at end of April 2019 stood at 2.01 per cent. Though the figure as at April fell short of the performance of GDP in last quarter of 2018 by -0.38 per cent, year-on-year, it recorded a growth of 2.54 percent compared to 1.89 percent growth achieved in first quarter of 2018. The growth achieved in the first quarter of 2019, according to the Statistician General, NBS, Dr. Yemi Kale, was the strongest the nation had achieved since 2015.
