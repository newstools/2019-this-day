BOA LAWYERS’ LEAGUE  Olisa Agbakoba Legal (OAL) sent out strong signals of its intentions to go far in this year’s BOA Lawyers’ Football Tournament with a convincing 4-0 defeat of Aluko & Oyebode in the second round first leg fixture last weekend.

According to the organisers of the tournament, the top four teams in each group will proceed to the next stage which promises to be even more exciting with home and away matches for the qualified teams. “After the home and away knockout stage, eight teams will automatically qualify and proceed to the quarter finals. In the event of a draw, penalties will be deployed as a decider. Each team is to play three penalties during the shoot out,” observed the statement from AstroTurf 2000.
