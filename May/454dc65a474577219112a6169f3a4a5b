The play’s Executive Producer is Joseph Edgar, an Investment Banker cum Theatre Producer who has in the last three years brought to the Nigerian Stage some very iconic productions, including Esugbayi which attracted Lagos Governor Akinwunmi Ambode last December. The play also has legendary Comedian Alibaba and iconic Showman Olisa Adibua as co-Executive Producers.
