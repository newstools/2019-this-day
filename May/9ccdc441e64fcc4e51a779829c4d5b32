Goddy Egene Trading at the stock market remained bearish last week as a combination of profit-taking in bellwethers and negative reactions to financial results released by companies for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019, dominated sentiments of investors. Consequently, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 1.78 per cent to close lower at 29,212.00, while market capitalisation shed N197 billion to be at N10.979 trillion. The year-to-date decline of the NSE ASI worsened to 7.1 per cent as last Friday. Just like the previous week, the market traded for four days and the bears and bulls controlled two days each. But the bears had the upper hand, leading to a decline of 1.78 per cent at the end of the week. Trading had started on Monday on a negative note with the NSE ASI falling 0.73 per cent following losses by Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc and Dangote Cement Plc. The negative trend was sustained on Tuesday with a higher decline of 1.23 per cent due to sell-off in Dangote Cement Plc, Nestle Nigeria Plc, Stanbic IBTC among others. But the market rebounded on Thursday and Friday, appreciating by 0.04 per cent and 0.14 per cent in that order. However, the gains in the two days were not enough to offset the losses of Monday and Tuesday. By the close of the week, three of the five major sectors declined led by the NSE Industrial Goods Index that fell 3.0 per cent. The NSE Banking Index trailed with 1.3 per cent, just as the NSE Consumer Goods Index went down by 0.3 per cent. On the positive side, the NSE Insurance Index rose 1.3 per cent, followed by NSE Oil and Gas Index that appreciated by 0.02 per cent. Commenting on the market, analysts at Afrinvest (West Africa) Limited said: “We view the market as lacking drivers for a sustained bullish run and so expect the market to continue to trade sideways, with profit-taking and bargain-hunting activities dominating an equal amount of trading session over the short term.” In their analysis, analysts at Meristem Securities Limited said the negative performance last week was partly due, “to the string of negative first quarter results, which cut across the different sectors of the market.” According to Meristem, the poor earnings performances were further pointers to weak consumer spending in the economy, even as many of the companies face different operating challenges. “It is therefore cheery news that the National Assembly passed the 2019 Budget, which includes provisions for the implementation of the new minimum wage. This should strengthen consumer spending, which has been faltering since the exit from recession. On the downside, however, it portends upside inflation risks, with the possibility of constraining the Monetary Policy Committee’s easing posture,” they said. Meanwhile, an analysis of the other markets in Africa, showed that Nigeria was the second highest loser following Ghana that recorded a decline of 2.4 per cent.   Kenya’s NSE 20 went down by 0.6 per cent, while Mauritius’ SEMDEX shed 0.4 per cent. Morocco’s Casablanca MASI closed with a marginal decline and ending its four week’s bullish run.  The Egypt EGX30 emerged as the lone gainer last week, rising by 0.3 per cent. Among the BRICS markets, three of the tracked indices trended southwards. The two markets that closed in the positive territory are South Africa and Russia.  The South Africa FTSE/JSE All Share rose 0.5 per cent after President Cyril Ramaphosa said government won’t cut jobs at state power utility Eskom. Similarly, Russia’s RTS marginally inched higher by 0.1 per cent. Conversely, China’s Shanghai Composite and India’s BSE Sens shed 0.3 per cent following the expiry of Iranian Oil Sanction Waivers on May 2nd, 2019. Also, the Brazil Ibovespa closed the week 0.3 per cent lower. In Asia and the Middle East, performance was mixed with the bears dominating. The Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul ASI led decliners with 0.7 per cent followed by Thailand’s SET Index and Qatar’s DSM 20 which dipped 0.3 per cent each. On the positive side, United Arab Emirates ADX General Index led gainers up 2.8 per cent trailed by Turkey’s BIST 100 that added  0.3 per cent.
