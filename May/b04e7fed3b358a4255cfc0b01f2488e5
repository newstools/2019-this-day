Balogun said that freestyle football had been more creative which should be used as a means of empowering the youth. “Freestyle involves a lot of creativity, this should propel us to do more for those that have engaged in it by bringing them to limelight. “We can also harness it as a means of empowerment of our jobless youths and also encourage more female participation in the sport as well,’’ he said.
