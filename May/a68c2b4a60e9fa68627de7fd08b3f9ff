She said, ‘‘For us, Golden Penny noodles is one of the top three brands in this category for over 10 years, so we are using this launch to excite our consumers by giving them another flavour . “We have done so much research on wheat flavours and their appeal to consumers, so we decided to come out with Jollof noodles flavour. This brand is one of its kind, made from a unique blend of spices that gives the intriguing jollof taste.’’ According to her, Golden Penny which currently holds 10 per cent of the N109bn noodles market share has the intention of increasing the market share even further.
