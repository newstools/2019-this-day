Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has said he was not able to attend the May Day event due to ill health. In a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media, Nwachukwu Obidiwe, the minister said: “Contrary to uncivilized attitude and barefaced lies contained in the address of the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, I wish to state for the avoidance of doubt that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Ngige, was absent at (yesterday) today’s Worker’s Day rally for ill-health reasons.” The statement said the minister has been down with flu since last Sunday, adding that “he met his doctors last Monday and has since been at home recuperating.”
