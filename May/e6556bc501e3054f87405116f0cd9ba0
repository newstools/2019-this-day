Vanessa Obioha Music and football lovers are in for a good treat as premium international beer brand, Heineken has reopened the upgraded Heineken House in Lagos. This reopening of the Heineken house is expected to open the door to the top-notch parties that Heineken has been known for. The Lagos Heineken House was first opened in 2016 as the first Heineken Champions Planet in Africa and later gave way for smaller pop-up experience centers across the nation in December of that year. As a brand, Heineken has been at the forefront of providing premium entertainment for fans, with football events and other lifestyle themed parties. The Heineken House serves as a melting point for sports lovers and fun seekers, to blend and share the excitement of new friendships. Senior Brand Manager, Mfon Bassey described the reopening as the return of premium entertainment and stated that the brand plans to make it a comfortable spot for everyone looking to feel the Heineken experience. He added that; “as a brand, we are keen on the type of experience we provide our consumers, that’s why we have made this spot better. By next weekend, we will be here again at the football arena to watch the UCL Finals, and that would be an even bigger party.” The first party to be held in the upgraded house is the Champions League Finals match viewing which will be happening on Saturday, June 1.
