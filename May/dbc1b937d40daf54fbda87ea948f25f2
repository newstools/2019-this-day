In a tweet on Monday, Akeredolu explained that with an estimated value of $145 billion in 2025, the state would be shortchanging itself if it ignores the marijuana business. “We all know that Ondo State is the hot bed of cannabis cultivation in Nigeria,” he wrote. “We know how to grow it and it thrives well in the Sunshine State. With an estimated value of $145 Billion in 2025, we would be shortchanging ourselves if we failed tap into the Legal Marijuana Market. “Our focus now is Medical Marijuana cultivation in controlled plantations under the full supervision of the @ndlea_nigeria.
