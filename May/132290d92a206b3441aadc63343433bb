Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City A lecturer in the Igbinedion University, Okada, identified as Kelvin Izebeokhai has been killed by gunmen, suspected to be robbers, operating near Okada junction along the Benin-Lagos highway. It was learnt that the robbers abducted other passengers in the bus the late Izebeokhai was traveling in. The driver of the mini bus was said to have ran into the bush along with four other passengers. Spokesman for the university, Mr. Jide Ilugbo, who confirmed the killing described it as barbaric. Ilugbo said late  Izebeokhai was a First Class graduate and was employed in the university three years ago. He said it was now hellish to travel along the Benin-Lagos highway due to frequent armed robbery attacks. His words, “It was unfortunate he ran into robbers. The trailer park before Okada junction is a hideout for criminals.” Edo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed DanMallam, confirmed the abduction and the death of the passenger. DanMallam said  Izebeokhai died during an escape bid when the victims were being marched  into the forest by the kidnappers. “Unfortunately one of the passengers who tried to escape during the abduction was killed by the gunmen. The police went after the kidnappers in the bush and succeeded in rescuing the victims.” He said the police were working on a new strategy which entails taking the war to the kidnappers’ den in the jungle, adding that it is the best way to tackle the scourge.
