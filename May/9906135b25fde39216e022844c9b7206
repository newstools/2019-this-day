The President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, has lauded Nigerian workers for their contribution to the socio-economic development of the country, in spite of some economic realities. Saraki, in a goodwill message to mark the 2019 Workers’ Day celebration, also commended the leadership and members of the organised labour for their patriotism in mostly choosing dialogue over industrial action in resolving trade disputes. He expressed hope that workers would be encouraged to always put in their best to uplift and sustain the nation’s economy, “in view of the recent signing into law of a new minimum wage of N30,000″. “No nation can develop without a virile and agile workforce. “It is trite to say that workers are the mainstay of our nation’s economy, since no policy of government, no matter how remote, will succeed without the commitment and collaboration of workers saddled with implementation. “Having interacted with Nigerian workers and their leadership times without number, I can say without fear of contradiction that the nation’s workforce is among the best in the continent. “All that is left is to adequately harness their abundant talents and spirit of patriotism to further improve on the nation’s economic and political development through timely and adequate motivation, training and retraining,” he said. Saraki advised the public sector, “to work to ensure that the country realised her potentials. “It should eliminate tardiness, increase the level of discipline and strive to provide enabling environment for the private sector to thrive with the resultant broadening of the scope of national prosperity”. He called on the leadership of organised labour to continue to discharge their responsibilities in the overall interest of the country. He assured labour that government would continue to do its best to meet the yearnings and aspirations of workers and other Nigerians through sustainable welfare programmes. (NAN)
