That effort led to  an injection of N40 billion  equity  into  through a rights issue last year.  That move  paid off for the company in  its nine months results when finance cost reduced by 34 per cent  to  N16.5 billion, from   N25.2 billion of the same period last year. According to the company,   the reduction is due to settlement of overdraft facilities and replacement of high interest yielding loans with more favorable loans. Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc last week reported a profit after tax of N7.895 billion for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, down from N13.247 billion recorded in the   corresponding period of the previous year. The profit was recorded from a revenue of N400.6 billion compared with N427.508 billion  in 2017. According to the company,  the  drop in revenue was  disappointedly related to the logistic upheavals posed by the traffic challenges in Apapa. Commenting on the result, the Group Managing Director, FMN, Paul Gbededo,  said:“The results are largely a reflection of our focus on driving volume growth while improving operational efficiency and ramping up strategic marketing and promotional activities to win over new market segments in our food business. Despite the devastating effect of the traffic congestions in Apapa on our operations, we are quite positive that we will see improvements across major business segments before the close of the financial year as we continue to focus on delivering on our promise of quality to our consumers.” The company noted that continued strong sales and brand building focus has ensured a further growth in market share and strengthened the group’s market leader position within the flour market.
