President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday evening hosted the national leader of the All Progressives Congress Bola Tinubu, at the the State House where broke Ramadan fast with the APC leader The President’s Personal Assistant (Photograph), Mr Sunday Aghaeze, in a pictorial report made this known in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that two of the pictures show the President and Tinubu on a dining table with variety of foods and drinks while the president was seen in the two other pictures escorting his guest. NAN reports that the sudden appearance of Tinubu at the Presidential Villa had finally put to rest the reported ‘political misunderstandings’ between the president and the APC leader. Tinubu’s absence during the President’s last visit to Lagos shortly before his 10-day private visit to London was misinterpreted in some quarters. Similarly, President Buhari’s inability to attend 2019 Tinubu’s colloquium at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, to mark his 67th birthday, was equally misinterpreted by some social commentators. The President, who was represented at the event, by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, was on official engagements at the villa where he was inaugurating the new Micro Pension Plan about the same time the colloquium was holding at the centre. President Buhari usually uses some days of the Ramadan to host political, traditional and religious leaders as well as other prominent and ordinary citizens to break Ramadan fast at the villa. (NAN)
