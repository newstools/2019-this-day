Dan mallam also added that 25 others were sentenced to life imprisonment. However, none of those sentenced to death were executed because the Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, did not sign the death warrant to put any of those sentenced to death. He, however, said some of the convicts have appealed their sentences, adding that the ministry duplicated 725 case files and treated 625 original case files. The former Commissioner said that the state granted over 200 inmates across the state pardon.
