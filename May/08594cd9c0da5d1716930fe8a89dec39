By Francis Sardauna in Katsina The outgoing Secretary to the Katsina State Government (SSG), Dr. Mustapha Inuwa, has said Governor Aminu Bello Masari’s inauguration for a second tenure will be low key considering the current security situation in the state. Addressing journalists on Tuesday, Inuwa said the state government was mindful of the security challenges bedevilling the state, hence the cancellation of activities lined up for the inauguration. The SSG noted that the present realities in the state were not ripe for any celebration, noting that only the swearing-in of the governor and his deputy would be done as enshrined in the 1999 constitution as amended. “If not because the constitution stipulates that the governors must be sworn in on May 29, probably that one too wouldn’t have taken place. But we hope that if the situation improves before June 12, government will come out with activities to mark the day,” he added. He assured the people of the state government’s commitment to ensuring that normalcy is restored in communities affected by bandits’ attacks and appealed to residents to intensify prayers for the sustainability of peace in the state.
