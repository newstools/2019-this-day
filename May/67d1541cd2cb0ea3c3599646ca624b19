Harry said becoming a parent was “amazing” as he held his son in his arms. “We’re just so thrilled to have our bundle of joy. We’re looking forward to spending some precious time with him as he slowly starts to grow up,” he said. Meghan said their son has the sweetest temperament. “It’s magic, it’s pretty amazing. I mean I have the two best guys in the world. So I’m really happy,” she gushed.
