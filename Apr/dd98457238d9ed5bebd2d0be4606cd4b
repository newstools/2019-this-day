Laiatu Bamaiyi in Birnin Kebbi The Kebbi State governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, has said that electricity consumers in the state will soon have meters installed for them by Kaduna Electricity Company (KEDCO). The governor stated this at the Government House in Birnin Kebbi during an interaction session with journalists and representatives of KEDCO and Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Bagudu explained that he met with officials of the electricity company last week under a new initiative by National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). He said private sector companies have been licensed to work in the power sector to produce meters. According to the governor, he was assured that the company would be coming to Kebbi to install meters and that the process would ensure that everyone get metered to avoid estimated billing. Bagudu called on journalists and all stakeholders to help in disseminating proper information about the electricity sector. “The press should help in disseminating information to help in making the public to be aware that electricity does not belong to the government. “Secondly, the government has done its bid in ensuring that transformers are in place in ensuring that transmission is working to ensure that every part of the state can receive 24-hour supply,” he said. He urged electricity consumers to reciprocate the gesture by always paying their bills in order to have round the clock supply of electricity.
