President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed shock and sadness over the terrible attacks on several churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on the holy day of Easter. He said Nigerians stand with the people of Sri Lanka at this very terrible moment. Buhari extended deepest condolences to the families of those killed in the attacks and wishes speedy recovery to the injured, according to a statement by Femi Adesina, special media adviser. “We stand with victims of terrorism all over the world because we know and understand this harrowing inhuman activity,” the President said. President Buhari urged the authorities not to spare the wicked elements behind these mischievous attacks. Nigeria, like Sri Lanka, is battling with insurgency of its own, created by Boko Haram terrorists who wanted to carve out a Caliphate. A Muslim terror group is also suspected to have masterminded the Sri Lankan bomb attacks, on hotels and churches in which over 160 died and hundreds injured. (NAN)
