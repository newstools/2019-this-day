The eagerly-awaited comedy masterpiece by Wale Adenuga Productions, titled Knockout, was premiered to thundering laughter and several standing ovations on Sunday, 14th April 2019, at the Silverbird Galleria, Victoria Island, Lagos. According to the Producer of Knockout, Wale Adenuga Jnr., “We’re glad everyone at the premiere had lots of fun and we apologise to those who suffered ‘Laughter Overdose’ from the hilarious movie. Seriously speaking though, Knockout is an excellent opportunity for the whole family to bond, laugh and learn especially this Easter holiday. In addition to the multiple superstars seen in the trailer, the movie has several unexpected cameo appearances from people you can’t even imagine; so we really recommend that you and your loved ones watch Knockout as soon as it starts showing this Easter weekend so you don’t hear any spoilers from your friends or on social media.” The glamorous event, which was serenaded by music by the Pefti Band, had in attendance over 500 dashingly-dressed distinguished dignitaries including Artistes such as Sola Sobowale, Hafeez “Saka” Oyetoro, Yaw, Funky Mallam, Charles Okocha, Josh2funny, Akpan & Oduma, Moji Oyetayo aka Mama Ajasco, MC Lively, Princess, Tony Akposheri, Big Bashorun, Victor Oyebode aka Boy Alinco, Yetunde Barnabas aka Miss Pepeiye, Bello Kreb.
