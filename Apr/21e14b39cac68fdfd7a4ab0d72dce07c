 Former governor Central Bank of Nigeria, Joseph Sanusi, and the former Vice Chancellor, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Prof. Wale Omolev were among those who celebrated with Elder Michael Ayodeji Oni on the occasion of his 85th birthday at his Dolphin Estate Lagos residence. They used the occasion to urge Nigerians, irrespective of calling, religion, tribe or political leaning, to thank God for His mercy, kindness and goodness and advised that they desist from the mad rush to acquire perishables of life, but to rather emulate Biblical teachings with absolute faith in God. The celebrant, Elder Oni, expressed his profound gratitude to God, the entire Rotary Club of Lagos community and other distinguished guests, clerics, other religious faithful and his family members that heartily contributed to the ultimate success of the day.
