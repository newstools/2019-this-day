Okoye said the review would also focus on processes of party registration, party primaries and nomination of candidates; quality of ad-hoc staff; relationship between the commission and diverse stakeholders, including political parties, security agencies, civil society organisations, the media and development partners; and quality of inclusivity of the elections, particularly regarding persons with disability, lDPs and gender balance. He noted that the two sets of activities are envisaged in the reviews as follows; internal reviews involving National Commissioners, Resident Electoral Commissioners, Electoral Officers, Collation and Returning Officers, as well as other key staff of the commission; review meetings with key stakeholders such as political parties, civil society organisations, security agencies, the media and development partners. Okoye revealed that these reviews and debriefing would take place between May and June 20l9.
