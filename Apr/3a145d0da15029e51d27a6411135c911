By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Security operatives comprising the army, police and others have laid siege to Mmiata Anam community in Anambra West Local Government Area following a weekend attack on farmers of the community by persons suspected to be herdsmen. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Haruna Mohammed, disclosed this to THISDAY in Awka, the Anambra State capital, while confirming the attack on the farmers. Though there were reports of the killing of six persons, Haruna said three persons were killed in the Saturday’s attack by suspected herdsmen. He said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mustapha Dandaura, had ordered full-scale investigation into the matter with a view to bringing the culprits to justice. He said: “The command has deployed two units of mobile policemen and other regular policemen to the area. We are working in conjunction with other security agencies in the operation. “Three persons were killed in the attack by suspected herdsmen. But we are on top of the situation and I can assure you that normalcy will soon return to the place.” On whether any arrest had been made, Mohammed said he would not want to speak further on issues that would jeopardise investigations, stating that the outcome of the investigation would be made available to the public at the appropriate time. A source in Mmiata Anam told THISDAY that the rampaging herdsmen had raped lots of women in the community, while beheading six men during the attack. The state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C-Don Adinuba, said Governor Willie Obiano was currently overseas, but might cut short his trip because of the development. Adinuba said a report of the incident had been sent to the governor.
