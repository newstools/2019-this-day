The Election Petitions Tribunal in Oyo State on Monday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to allow Mr Adebayo Adelabu, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to inspect election materials used in the March 9 governorship election. INEC had declared Mr. Seyi Makinde of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) winner of the governorship election after polling 515,621 votes to defeat Adelabu who had 357,982. Other respondents in the case are the PDP and INEC. The Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice Anthony Akpovi, said he gave the order after considering the application made by Adelabu on its merit and felt it would help the petitioners in maintaining their case against the respondents. He ordered INEC to allow the petitioners and their agents to inspect and obtain all polling documents used in the March 9 governorship election in the custody of INEC. Akpovi directed INEC to make available all ballot papers, voter registers and copies of all election materials in all polling units. Earlier, Mr Olajide Ola, counsel to Adelabu, had prayed the court to grant his motion experte to inspect the governorship election materials in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Adelabu and his party, APC, filed a petition at the tribunal against INEC for declaring Makinde of the PDP winner of the governorship election. (NAN)
