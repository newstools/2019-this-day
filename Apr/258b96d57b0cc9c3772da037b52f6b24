By Azuka Ogujiuba Wisdom is attributed to building. When you go to build anything you have two options, it’s either you build on the Rock or you build on the sand. The Wise Woman digs deep beneath the surface. She never builds until she finds the Rock! She keeps digging and never settles until she finds the Rock! We have made 30 from the best hairs sourced world wigs to celebrate the wisdom women exhibit daily. This collection is made to celebrate our versatility, strength and diversity of  the Hair by Ugo woman.
