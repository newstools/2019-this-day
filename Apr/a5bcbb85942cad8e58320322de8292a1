Goddy Egene Bearish sentiments persisted at the Nigerian equities market last week as domestic investors focused on receiving the dividends paid by banks for the 2018 financial year. Also, the mixed first quarter results announced by companies contributed to the weak demand by investors. While stocks remained attractive due to low valuations resulting from extended bearish run, investors were last week busy at annual general meetings (AGMs) approving dividends already declared for 2018. Most of the shareholders who spoke to THISDAY, said they were more concerned about getting their dividends for now. “My focus is to receive all the dividends declared by the companies, including banks were I have investments. After that I will then look at investing more since most of the prices are very attractive now,” an investor said.
