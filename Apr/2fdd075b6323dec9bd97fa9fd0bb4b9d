Sunday Ehigiator Eventstracer.com; a Nigeria’s leading events experience experts and foremost online business events hub, is set to host the 2019 Small and Medium Sized Event Planners’ summit, themed ‘Growing my Event’. The summit will take place at Best Western Star Fire Hotel, G.R.A, Ikeja, Lagos on Saturday, May 4, 2019 by 10am prompt. At a pre-summit media briefing, the General Manager, Maxwell Nzekwe explained that the summit will provide participants with transformational knowledge about events management and business skills. According to him, “the speakers at the summit had been carefully selected based on their broad experience, achievements and expertise across all aspects of the event management industry. The program will conclude with a post-summit networking session at the summit venue.” Nzekwe noted that, “despite the growth in Nigeria’s event industry, research carried out by eventstracer showed that gaps still exist in the provision of value to stakeholders in the event industry. “The stakeholders include sponsors, event owners, exhibitors, event venue owners and event visitors. The event value chain which consists of event naming, event design, venue choice and event execution still requires plenty of development for the event industry to keep growing and this is one of the reasons eventstracer is organising this summit. “Speakers include the Convener of the Nigeria International Film Summit (NIFS) which is held annually in Lagos, Paris and Los Angeles, Ijeoma Onah; Executive Director of Balmoral Events Limited, Adegoke Obembe; one of Nigeria’s largest event and event venue managers, and Folasade Odunaiya, a certified Business Coach.” Also present at the media briefing were Eventstracers Head of Business Development, Mrs. Uloma Okonkwo, and Head of Products, Mr. Victor Okechukwu.
