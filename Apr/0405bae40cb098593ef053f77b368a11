Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Nafi’u Usman Ibrahim, a second degree student of the Maryam Abacha American University in Niger State, has emerged winner of this year’s international Qur’anic recitation competition that took place in Kuwait. Nafi’u who had his first degree in Microbiology and is studying for a second degree at MAAUN, is an indigene of Bauchi State in the North-east of Nigeria. In an interview with the Nigerian Ambassador to Kuwait, Ambassador Garba Gajam, on the Hausa service of the BBC, he confirmed the outcome and expressed excitement. The ambassador said “: what excites me most about the young man, who is a second degree student of the Maryam Abacha American University in Niger, is that the rigours of his conventional studies have not stopped him from memorising the holy Quran. “He has set a good example to those who see the modern education in a negative light that it is wrong, everything depends on the nature of the child’s upbringing by the parents.” He further explained that that Nafi’u has not only won himself gifts but has also made Nigeria great by raising its image internationally. He explained that Nigeria has been having cordial relations with Kuwait since the 1960s. The ambassador called on the Northern states governors, especially Sokoto and Zamfara, to support the body charged with the responsibility of organising the competition at the Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto.
