Scheduled for Easter Sunday, April 21, the festival will feature performances from DJ Obi, Naira Marley, Simi, Teni the Entertainer, Runtown, Sho Madjozi to mention a few. Homecoming live music show is famous for its unique performance format: replacing a traditional ‘headline’ hierarchy with a more democratic ‘back-to-back’ set up, where artists of all types and genres take the stage in a continuous ‘playlist’ of contemporary music from the African continent and further afield. The festival will take place at Harbour Point, Victoria Island, Lagos.
