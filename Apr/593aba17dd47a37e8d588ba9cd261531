By Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said it had uncovered fresh plots by leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to smear Senator Ademola Adeleke. The party in a statement Saturday by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party already had information on how the APC used a former commissioner in the state to reach out to certain top security officers to use the fabrications to arrest and embarrass Senator Adeleke and the Principal of his School, Ede Muslim High School, Ede, Mr. Kadili Adejare Abass. He stressed that the main opposition party had intelligence of attempts by agents of the APC to hack into the school files to mutilate relevant academic documents, just to get at Adeleke, not minding the harm such would cause other students of the school. Ologbondiyan stated: “Having failed in their project to brand Senator Adeleke’s School Certificate as fake, APC leaders, including those operating from Lagos state, are now knitting a very ludicrous allegation that the School Testimonial of the Osun Governor-Elect was forged, with a view to smearing his image in the eyes of the unsuspecting public. “Our party has also been fully informed of how huge sums of money has been forwarded as bribe to the compromised security agents to arraign and humiliate Senator Adeleke and Mr. Adejare Abass on fabricated charges, even when they know they cannot prove any case. “Such wickedness can only come from depraved and decadent individuals who are desperate to subvert the will of the people at all costs.” The party called on Nigerians, particularly the people of Osun, to continue to be at alert in resisting the noxious schemes of the APC against their will as a people. It also counseled the APC to accept its defeat in the Osun Governorship election and desist from acts of mischief against Adeleke as such will all come to naught.
