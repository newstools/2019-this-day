The Police in Zamfara State yesterday confirmed the killing of 10 people in the state by suspected kidnappers and cattle rustlers. The spokesman of the state police command, Mr. Mohammed Shehu, said yesterday that bandits on motorcycles invaded onion fields on Saturday outside the village of Kware in the Shinkafi district and shot dead farmers. “We received a report of an attack in Kware by bandits in which 10 people were killed. Security personnel were dispatched to the area to restore order,” Shehu explained. However, he did not give details of the reason for the attack. Suspected armed bandits had in December 2018 sacked three communities in Birnin Magaji LGA in the state, killing at least 25 residents. Some of those killed were said to be working on their farms when they were attacked. In February, the orgy of violence in the state continued as 41 persons were killed by bandits who invaded Birane, a sleepy agrarian village in Zurmi Local Government Area of the state. Shehu had in a statement, confirmed the incident and said it was a conflict between hunters, local vigilantes and the bandits. Gunmen had earlier this month killed 40 persons in two communities in Shinkafi and Anka LGAs of the state. The killings came barely two days after the police in the state disclosed that 29 people were killed on Saturday by suspected bandits in Shinkafi LGA.
