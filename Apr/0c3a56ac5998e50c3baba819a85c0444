Footage has emerged of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signalling a tactical change in formation during Manchester United’s defeat by Barcelona by handing striker Marcus Rashford a paper note. Rashford, after reading it, dropped it onto the turf – only for Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to pick it up and discover Solskjaer’s tactical secrets. He didn’t appear too impressed, however, chucking it back onto the pitch. The contents of that note can also be revealed, with Solskjaer writing down the new team formation – 4-4-2. Even that tactical switch by Solskjaer could not prevent Manchester Unitedcrashing out of the Champions League on Tuesday night. Lionel Messi’s early brace had forced the United boss to change tact and move Anthony Martial up front alongside Rashford. It didn’t work out as Philippe Coutinho added a stunning third in the second half to send Barca through to the semi-finals 4-0 on aggregate. In the video, Rashford jogs onto the pitch and examines the note that was handed to him on the bench. He then drops the piece of paper to the turf after a collision with Gerard Pique near the edge of the Barcelona penalty area. Ter Stegen then proceeds to read the hand-written note before disposing of it himself. The note showed names of players in the new formation. It showed Martial and Rashford up front with Jesse Lingard on the right and Paul Pogba on the left. Scott McTominay and Fred are the two central midfielders. The defence remained the same – Victor Lindelof, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Ashley Young.
