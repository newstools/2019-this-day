Segun Awofadeji in Gombe As campaigns for Nigeria’s 9th Senate leadership gathers momentum, the Gombe State All Progressive Party publicity secretary, Naomi Joel Awak, has lent her voice to the call on elected senators to back Senator Mohammed Danjuma Goje for the position of the Senate President. In an interview with journalists in Gombe Saturday, the APC spokesperson said senators Ali Ndume of Borno State and Ahmed Lawan of Yobe State cannot match the former Gombe State Governor in terms of political qualifications for the plum Senate seat. According to her, Goje is not only a powerful figure in Gombe politics but a political force to be reckoned with in the power equation of the Northeast geo-political zone. She said Goje is a grassroots politician having won elections for State Assembly in the former Bauchi state and rose to the position of Governor for eight uninterrupted years adding that he was also a former Minister and currently going for his third term in the Senate. The APC Publicity Secretary said one of the greatest leadership qualities bestowed on Goje is his political patriotism to the APC and his ability to keep the APC intact in Gombe State despite the party’s daunting challenges in other states. These are qualities that surpass senators Lawan and Ndume put together, she opined. “Goje is capable of leading the Senate because he was able to lead the party in Gombe state to capture power convincingly from the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party in the last general elections.” Speaking on the party’s position at the national level to support Lawan, Awak said that as a party loyalist, she is only appealing that the party and elected senators look the way of Goje as she is convinced he is the man capable of doing the job well and who will protect the integrity of the party, the country and the President of the country.
