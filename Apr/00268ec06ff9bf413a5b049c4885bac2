The League Management Company (LMC) has fined Katsina United N1million and a possible banishment from the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium for severally not allowing visiting teams access to train on their registered home ground for matches as provided by the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) Framework and Rules. LMC announced the penalties Wednesday after reviewing the complaints by three other clubs and a similar complaint by Rangers International that they were prevented from gaining access to the Mohammed Dikko Stadium on Tuesday for a rescheduled fixture. Following a charge of misconduct in breach of Rule C1 of the Rules, the LMC exercised its summary jurisdiction to impose the fine on Katsina United. LMC’s Chief Operating Officer, Salihu Abubakar, in a letter conveying the decision to the club, stated, “You are in breach of Rule C1 (Misconduct) of the Framework and Rules of the Nigeria Professional Football League, in that you severally prevented or failed to permit the visiting teams from gaining access to your registered home ground for the scheduled pre-match training, thereby failing, inter alia, to act in the best interest of the game and comply with the principles of fair play and sportsmanship”. “Consequently, the LMC intends to exercise its summary jurisdiction and to impose on you the following sanctions: 1. A fine of One Million Naira (N1, 000, 000.00) for the several acts of misconduct and 2. A caution, to wit, in the event of a repeated breach, further or more severe sanctions could be applied, including but not limited to relocation of the club to another ground in the overriding interest and other considerations,” observed LMC in a statement yesterday evening. Katsina United has under the rules 48 hours to respond in writing with an option to accept the decision of the LMC or enter for a hearing. MFM, Kwara United, Insurance of Benin and Lobi Stars variously complained of inability to access the stadium for pre-match training.
