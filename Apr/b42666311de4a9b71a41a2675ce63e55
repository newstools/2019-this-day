After nearly 10 years, Jobberman CEO & Co-Founder is leaving the company to pursue his passion of building and backing enduring companies by becoming a professional investor. Jobberman is the leader in the online recruitment space in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa – since 2016 belonging to the ROAM Group – with more than 2 million registered professionals and over 50,000 employers. Matthew Page, Head of Jobs of Ringier One Africa Media (ROAM) steps in as interim CEO and he has this to say: “We wish Ayodeji incredible success in the future and we are grateful for the impressive work he has done in building a remarkable brand”. Ayodeji shared some remarks: “It is truly overwhelming but I have the comfort of knowing I leave Jobberman in better hands than my own. It is such an incredible feeling and honour to experience what you founded take a life of its own. I think it is great timing to say goodbye and explore what is next. I will remain close to the company and have full faith in the team  and new management to continue to solve Nigeria’s recruitment needs.”
