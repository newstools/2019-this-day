Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The All Progressives Con-gress (APC) has said that there is no row between its National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, as was being insinuated by a section of the media. In a statement issued yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Isa-Onilu, APC described as mischievous, the attempt to misrepresent Oshiomhole’s statement that National Working Committee (NWC) did not have any formal alliance with African Action Congress (AAC). “Our attention has been drawn to some reports in the media purporting a disagreement between the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi over the alignment of the Rivers State APC with the governorship candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Awara Biokpomabo. “It is regrettable that the APC National Chairman’s statement is being twisted to suit a jaundiced narrative. This narrative is at best, mischievous, pedestrian and should be disregarded,” the statement explained. It said the APC chairman’s statement is unambiguous to the effect that the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) does not have any formal alliance with AAC. “This is without prejudice to any local arrangement that may exist. Both Oshiomhole and Ameachi are above the petty insinuations being orchestrated by a section of the media. Like many leaders of the party, APC National Chairman, Oshiomhole and the Minister of Transport, Amaechi enjoy cordial relationship and do share mutual respect; therefore, deliberate misinterpretation of issues and statements from the party or between the two of them would continue to fail,” the party added.
