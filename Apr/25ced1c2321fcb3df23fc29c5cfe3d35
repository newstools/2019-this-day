  According to him, any of the youths with humble background should not consider such as a stumbling block towards succeeding in life, stressing that he also came from similar parentage.  He said: “I am a Nigerian with a humble beginning. I came from a humble background like some of you. My father was a tailor, while my mother was a trader. So, your background should not be a hindrance to your success.  “To succeed in life, you must possess some qualifications like positive mental attitude. You must first develop that attitude and then you act it. Visualise what you want to be, act and work hard towards achieving it.  “Even when you are in your bathroom, talk to yourself. My God, I want to be this or that; although it is not only about just wishing to be, but also about working towards achieving it.  “In the words of Walt Disney, ‘all our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them’. In the process of pursuing your dreams, people will mount obstacles in your way; some will discourage you, but don’t give up.”
