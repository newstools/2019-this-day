The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said  the fact that the valedictory session of the federal cabinet will be  held on 22 May 2019 does not mean that the cabinet will be dissolved  on the same day. Clarifying his earlier statement to State House correspondents after  Thursday’s Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja, the  Minister said it is the prerogative of the President to dissolve the cabinet anytime he chooses. ”It is therefore inaccurate to extrapolate from my statement – that the FEC valedictory session will hold on 22 May – to say that the  President will dissolve the cabinet on the same day. They do not mean  the same thing,” he said.
