The Edo Government has reiterated that the fake recruitment advertisement put out on the website, www.recruitmentportalngr.com, did not emanate from the State’s Civil Service Commission or any other government agency.  In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, said the operators of the website are not known to any agency of government, warning members of the public to be wary of their antics.  According to him: “It is pertinent to reiterate that the state government is currently not recruiting. The Civil Service Commission is not recruiting. So, the information on the website is false and targeted at deceiving unsuspecting members of the public. We have no business with them whatsoever, as the state government nor the commission, in particular, is currently recruiting.”  The governor’s aide warned job seekers to be vigilant and ensure they do not fall prey to the antics of the operators of the website, adding, “Much as we are committed to creating jobs in Edo State, we are transparent in our operations and want to enjoin job seekers to be wary of the antics of those running fake job advertisements.  “The last recruitment exercise in the state was in 2018 when over 500 workers were employed, including the physically challenged. The information on a 2019 recruitment on the website, www.recruitmentportalngr.com is false, misleading and should be disregarded by all.”
