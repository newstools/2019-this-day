Theologians must have forgotten to exempt the name of the late Prof. Dora Akunyili from the biblical version which says that the dead should bury its own, while the living take care of theirs, but however, the holy book in that passage may give leeway to her kind of person to be ever celebrated by the living. Penultimate Tuesdays in Abuja, the late czer of the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control, NAFDAC was celebrated in death during the 25th anniversary celebrations of the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control, NAFDAC. At the well-attended event, memories of the late Akunyili, who held sway as the Director-General of the Agency between 2001 and 2009 came alive. Unarguably, there is no mincing the fact that she gave the Agency the recognition it is enjoying today.
Very fearless and dogged, she was the nemesis of the undisciplined elements whose aim was to flood the drug market with adulterated products, thereby sending helpless Nigerians to their early grave.
For the first time, she was honoured with a posthumous award by the Agency. While presenting the award to the family of the deceased, the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, showered praises on her for her hard work and incorruptible disposition. The first lady also prayed Almighty God to grant her soul eternal repose, while she embraced the family and thanked them for the support and memories being kept in her honour. Indeed, it was a season of honour for her, as she was also recognized in death by the organisers of the Miss Inspire Nigeria Beauty Pageant 2019 with Legendary Achievement Award for championing the course of NAFDAC. The event was attended by Nigeria’s First Lady alongside the world’s most powerful women like Michelle Obama, wife of the former United States of America. It will be recalled that she passed on after a protracted battle with cancer in June 2014 at an India hospital.
