The event, which was held in the London Stock Exchange studio, was organised to provide a comprehensive analysis of the very best across various areas of business endeavours in each market around the world. Receiving the award on behalf of FBNHoldings, its Group Managing Director, UK Eke, was quoted in a statement to have said, “receiving this award from World Finance basically tells us two things. One, it’s an affirmation of what we are doing in corporate governance, beyond the giant strides we’re making in financial performance. “So we see this as an endorsement of the brand, and it’s a bragging right for us. Because again, there are very few institutions in Nigeria that have benefited from this award. We are truly proud to receive this award.”  FBN Holdings Plc is the non-operating financial holding company of one of the largest banking and financial services organisations in Africa.
