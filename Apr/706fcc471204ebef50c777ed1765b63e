Visitor Mapwanya of Zimbabwe is a major absentee as the FCT Classic, the third event on the African Tour roaster, tees off today at the IBB International Golf and Country Club, Abuja. Mapwanya famously edged Vincent Torgah of Ghana in a tense playoff to win third version of the tournament on March 3, 2018. The main tournament will get underway with 40 players on the draw sheet after four players joined following the 18-hole qualifying round held on Monday. The three-ball of E. Ocheje, S. Okoromi and M. Musa will set the tone for the rest of the players when they file out at 8 a.m. Tournament favourite Torgah, will play in the seventh group, which composes Friday Akpodiete, Francis Epe and U. Saater. They will hit the fairway at 9 a.m. Torgah has already won the first two events of the 2019 season-Eko Challenge Cup and the Memorare- and will be looking forward to extend his winnings to three on the trot. This edition features international players from Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The FCT Classic is a 72-hole stroke play event contested over four days with a cut set after 36 holes. The winner will walk away with $4,000 Order of Merit points.
