After spending over two weeks preparing for the new basketball season in Akure, the Ondo State capital, Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Women Basketball Club are back in Lagos.  Head Coach, Aderemi Adewunmi has however granted the girls two weeks break to enable them recover from the very strenuous exercise in Akure which left a lot of the girls physically exhausted.  Meanwhile, MFM Director of Sports, Godwin Enakhena has charged the girls to keep in shape while on break to enable them return to camp in top shape.  “After a very tedious fitness regime in Akure, I have approved coach Aderemi’s request for the girls to have some days off to recover after the rigorous exercise they had to undergo in Akure. “From what I have seen and heard of the girls, I have no doubt in my mind that they will be the team to beat when the season begin later this month or May”, he concluded.  The MFM Women’s Basketball club which is sponsored by Dr Daniel Olukoya, General Overseer, MFM Worldwide joined the Premier League last season and missed out narrowly on a place on the continent after losing the 3rd place game to the Nigeria Customs Basketball to finish 4th.
