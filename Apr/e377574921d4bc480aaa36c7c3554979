Former Senate Leader and frontline candidate for the office of Senate President in the 9th National Assembly, Sen. Ali Ndume, has urged Nigerians to imbibe culture of love and peaceful co-existence, without which there would be no meaningful progress in the country. Ndume who decried the spate of banditry and its attendant killings across the country, called for retrospection among people of different faith, saying the simple explanation for strife and hostility among tribal communities is the absence of love for one another. The former Senate Leader, in an Easter message to Christian faithful, signed by hIm and made available to reporters Friday in Abuja, said the import of the Easter celebration must not be lost on believers but should rather call for reflection especially now that the country is going through some difficult time. He said the 9th senate will work hard for the well-being of the people, expressing confidence that the President Muhammadu Buhari led All Progressives Congress (APC) government is poised to take the country to the next level. Ndume said “the common enemies Nigerians must seek to fight are hunger, poverty, unemployment and those societal ills that threaten “us and our values as a people.” “That is why it is imperative for government at local, state and federal levels to strive to address the growing problem of poverty -material and values, which is part of reasons for the tension in the land.
