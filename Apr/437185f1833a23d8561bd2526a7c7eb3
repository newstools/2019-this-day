Rapheal Oshionebo, popularly known as RIO is a musician who has undoubtedly built a name for himself and the industry, standing on excellence and great vibes. He talks to Tosin Clegg about his journey, career so far, new music and more How did the journey start? I started my musical journey as a young kid growing up in Edo State. I had always known I would do this and even while in the university, I had always known I was going to do music professionally. Little wonder I got signed on by a record label immediately after I graduated from the University. What kind of music do you do? I focus on the genres of music that inspire me and bring out the best of my musical abilities which are Afro beat, Hip Hop, R&B and Reggae. I acknowledge the likes of Fela, Wizkid and Tuface as those that have largely influenced me musically over the years. Tell us about gaining more grounds in the industry? I started out my music career signing a three year contract with the record label, SS Sounds. This was where I developed my vocal prowess and further harnessed my musical artistry. After leaving the record label, I delved a bit into real estate business, which was quite short-lived, as I soon went back to doing music professionally which had always been my passion and forte.  What should we be expecting from your stable soon? I’m coming out with a bang and plans are in place to drop my new single. It’s been so much work putting this together and I can’t wait for everyone to hear it.
