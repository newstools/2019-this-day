 James Sowole in Akure Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Thursday described as a huge loss the passage of Olowo of Owo, Oba David Victor Folagbade Olateru-Olagbegi. Akeredolu, who condoled with the late monarch’s immediate family, the people of Owo kingdom and the citizens of the state, noted that the sunshine state had lost one of its most cerebral royal fathers. The governor, in a statement signed by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Yemi Olowolabi, noted that the late monarch combined deep intellectual capacity with admirable traditional flamboyance. Akeredolu described the late Olowo as a law scholar of no mean repute and a devout Christian whose reign ignited a remarkable revival of pentecostal evangelism in the legendary palace of Olowo of Owo. He also observed that in spite of the late monarch’s commitment to Christianity, the rich, robust and transcendental culture and traditions of Owo kingdom flourished under his leadership just the same way Owo witnessed unprecedented development and all-round peace. On behalf of the state government and the people of Ondo State, Akeredolu thanked President Muhammadu Buhari, other state governors and distinguished Nigerians from all walks of lives for their condolence messages as well as the comforting calls over “the loss of the great son of Ondo State.” Oba Olateru-Olagbegi joined his ancestors after an illness at University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Oyo State.
