 Worried by the inability of the 11 distribution companies to distribute power to many consumers, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has said it is considering a new regulation to allow third-party investors take up and maintain parts of the vast electricity distribution networks currently owned by the Discos.
The regulatory agency said the proposed regulation was necessitated by the lack of capacity of the Discos to deliver electricity to many consumers.
