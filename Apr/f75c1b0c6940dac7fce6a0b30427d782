Ugo Aliogo Missionaries Pastors Organisation (MPO) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to release the certificate of return to the Senator-elect of Imo West senatorial district, Imo State, Rochas Okorocha. Speaking at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday, the National President of the group, Prophet Emmanuel Stephen, noted that the proper thing to do is to issue the certificate of return to Okorocha, stating that if anybody is offended, the individual should go to court. Stephen, who was represented by Archbishop Onyeagoziri Okeugo, noted that as the electoral umpire, INEC should show a high level of integrity in the issue, adding that the eye of the international community is observing what has been unfolding in Nigeria. “We are calling on INEC to take note that the eye of international community is watching. Even a common man in the street knows that politics is being played somehow. Also, to compliment with the spirit of integrity of President Muhammadu Buhari, who stands against corruption, I hereby on behalf of MPO call for the release of Okorocha certificate of return,” the cleric said. Okorocha had stated that INEC does not have any moral or constitutional justification to withhold his certificate of return by acting on a mere allegation by the returning officer, Prof. Innocent Ibeabuchi, who might be playing a script by his political enemies. According to him, “I cannot understand how a mere allegation of an individual talking under duress, which has not been proven by anybody, will stop INEC from giving me my certificate of return for an election that I won properly. “I cannot understand why a report of a professor who lied will now be taken more than the report of the Nigeria Police and the State Security Service (SSS) that there was no crisis during the election. The returning officer should therefore be called to order.”
