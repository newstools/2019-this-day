 The National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, yesterday explained his support for the candidacy of Senate Leader, Senator Ahmad Lawan, and Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, for ninth National Assembly leadership, saying it is in compliance with the directive of the ruling party.
The APC had nominated Lawan and Gbajabiamila for the presidency of the Senate and the speakership of the House of Representatives respectively and enjoined all its members-elect in both chambers to support them when the National Assembly is convened in June.
But a couple of members-elect had kicked against the party’s directive, insisting that they would exercise their rights to contest the positions even as this development tends to enhance the chances of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to determine which of the contending APC members-elect would mount the saddle of leadership.
Indications at the weekend were that the PDP members-elect would vote as a bloc in a strong bid to frustrate the APC’s determination to have its choice candidates emerge winners.

This is coming in the wake of the 43 PDP senators-elect’s agreement to work as a team towards the election of presiding officers of the ninth Senate in June.
Sources close to Lawan, a strong contender for the 9th Senate presidency, told Thisday that the Lawan group made telephone calls during the Easter break to the senators-elect about the project at hand.
