 Onnoghen Resigned Because of EFFC Report 
However, a renowned lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Robert Clarke while reacting to the resignation of Onnoghen, said the former Chief Justice should have ignored those that egged him on and resigned earlier than he did.
Clarke said that if he had not resigned and government was able to prove the allegations preferred against him, he would have gone for it, but now that he had resigned, government might withdraw the case because “there is no need flogging a dead horse.”
He also said that Onnoghen might have resigned because he knew the weightiness of the report the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has against him, noting that if you commit sin and seek for forgiveness to God, God may forgive you but it is not so with government.
“He resigned because he knows what EFCC has on him. Government knows more than what ordinary citizens know and you can only know what they know when you go up there yourself. We should not be influenced by the political climate but look at issues as they are,” he said.
