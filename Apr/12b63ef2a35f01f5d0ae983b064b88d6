By Joseph Ushigiale, Demola Ojo and Vanessa Obioha It was a fitting end to a well choreographed fashion event superbly put together by the Arise Media as fashion makers, models and a cross section of fashion enthusiasts heaped encomiums on the organisers for another superlative show which ended in Lagos last night.
Now rated as the biggest fashion event on the continent, the show, which held at the Intercontinental Hotel, Lagos, opened April 19 and closed last night, pooled global fashion brands and models to the Lagos runway. It featured over 30 local and international designers from Africa, America and Europe, as well as over 150 models.
