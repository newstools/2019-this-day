By Ferdinand  Ekechukwu 9ice’s video to his new song ‘Wahala Dey’ is gathering momentum. The video directed by Unlimited L.A. is enjoying good airtime on music television stations across the country. It is a follow up to his recent song ‘Mercy’ as the singer/entertainer (real name, Abolore Akande) never relents in giving out good vibes. The Alapomeji Ancestral Records head honcho, 9ice, won the award for Best Hip Hop Artiste at the MTV Africa Music Awards in 2008. After recording his first demo, 9ice joined the group Mysterious Boys, with whom he did a couple of tracks before going on to form his own, now defunct, group, Abinibi. Having recorded his first demo, titled Risi De Alagbaja, in 1996, and his first solo song, ‘Little Money’ in 2000, 9ice had to wait until 2005 before gaining recognition in the Nigerian music market. The first major break for 9ice came from his first single, “Little Money”. Soon after this, he did collaborations with different Nigerian artistes that prompted the release of another hit single, ‘Ganja Man’. ID Cabasa produced this single, which was released with other songs in March 2006. The reggae tone and playful style of the song made it an instant hit. 9ice’s first album did well, and included the songs Little Money, Ganja Man, Make Dem Talk and Music Daddy. ‘Gongo Aso’, his second album released 2008, included songs covering success, originality, partying and women, as well as themes on the institution of marriage and gratitude. He has eight studio albums to his name which includes; Certificate (2007), Tradition (2009), Versus (2011) Bashorun Gaan (2011), Deluxe Version Versus & Bashorun Gaa (2011), CNN/GRA (2014), ID Cabasa (2016) and G.O.A.T (2018). 9ice is known for his use of the Yoruba language in his music, and he sometimes mixes Yoruba proverbs with English, Pidgin English, Hausa and Igbo.
