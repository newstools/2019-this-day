Mondayletter2 There are many people who think many teachers should be fired for not doing their job properly but in the latest case of educational stupidity a teacher has been sacked for being honest. Diane Tirado is/was a teacher at West Gate K-8 School in Port St Lucie, USA. This school has a rather generous 50% minimum for any work even if there is no work. Does that school pay their teachers 50% of their wages when they don’t even turn up? If so, then I am willing to ‘work’ there. Students should be encouraged and rewarded for their work, the important word being WORK. In most real world cases a zero performance gets a zero reward.  No teacher should be sacked for doing the sensible thing unless the world has gone mad although it appears to happen frequently in the educational environment. Sack 50% of this school education board where there is 0% sensible thinking.  Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia
