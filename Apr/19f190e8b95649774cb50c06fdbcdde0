Aruna Quadri made an attempt to rally back into the game in the fourth game and he started leading just like he did in the first game but the super finish of Fan Zhendong again came to fore as he leveled up against to win at 11-9. The match ended 4-0 (12-10, 11-2, 11-6, 11-9) in faovur of the Chinese star.

For Aruna Quadri, making the last 32 of the world championship is another feat as the Nigerian has never gone beyond the second since he made his debut at Zagreb 2007 in Croatia. And the Nigerian was disappointed for not winning a game against the Chinese, while hoping for better ranking when the new ranking is released next week. The tournament enters the last 16 stage as Brazil’s Hugo Calderano became the first player outside Europe and Asia to make it to the last 16 of the competition in the last five decades. The Brazilian defeated his Indian counterpart to berth in the last 16 and set up a tie against defending champion – China’s Ma Long.
