Two-time champions Nigeria finished as winners of Group A of the ongoing Africa U17 Cup of Nations in Tanzania after forcing Uganda to a 1-1 draw at the Chamazi Stadium in Dar es Salaam Saturday. In a pattern that has stuck with them since the tournament began, the Golden Eaglets created a basketful of chances, wasting them one after the other, starting from Akinkunmi Amoo’s poor touch after a sweet team move in the 17th minute. In the 70th minute, Uganda drew first blood as the Nigeria defence ball-watched from a corner kick. Davis Ssekajja’s pull out only got a slight touch from Sunday Stephen, and substitute John Alou had the simplest task of nodding into an empty net. Two minutes later, with the goalkeeper to beat, Wisdom Ubani – who got a brace against Tanzania on the opening day but is yet to add to that despite his high work rate and activity – wasted another clear chance. But a minute later, Nigeria were level as Ibraheem Jabaar read a long pass from substitute Olakunle Olusegun quite well and pushed it beyond onrushing goalkeeper Komakech with the Ugandan defence in no man’s land. In Wednesday’s semi finals, the Golden Eaglets will play against the second –placed team in Group B, which would be sorted out today as leaders Cameroon confront Senegal and second –placed Guinea tackle Morocco. Angola join Nigeria in the semi finals from Group A, following their 4-2 defeat of Tanzania, as the host nation ended up losing all three group phase matches, conceding 12 goals.
