Lovers of music and fashion stand a chance to shine in the spotlight as Homecoming Festival announces its latest initiative to spotlight emerging Nigerian creative talent, a new competition open to young creatives in Lagos and beyond. Musical artists and designers are invited to upload their songs, performances, designs and clothing collections to Instagram, using the hashtag #HomecomingNewArtist (for musicians) and #HomecomingNewDesigner (for designers/brands) for a chance to appear at the festival this Easter Weekend. One musical artist will be chosen from Instagram to perform for an audience of fans and celebrities alongside the all-star lineup which include Simi, Wizkid, Skepta and Runtown, among others, at the live music show on April 21 at Harbour Point, Victoria Island, Lagos. Also, a lucky designer will also have the opportunity to feature at the festival’s Pop-up which will run from April 19 to 21 at XII Glover, Lagos. The opportunity will avail the designer a platform to sell their clothing at a special brand booth alongside a lineup of the world’s most essential streetwear brands such as Wafflesncream, Alyx and others. The competition will be open for 24 hours and winners will be announced on Thursday, April 18.
