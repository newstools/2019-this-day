Suspected herdsmen reportedly attacked Numa-Kochu village in Andaha community of Akwanga Local Government Area of the state killing 17 Mada natives at a naming ceremony. The killings however created panic in the surrounding villages of Andaha community causing 2,563 inhabitants of the community to relocate to safer places within the local government.

Speaking when donating the relief materials to the displaced persons in Akwanga, the Director of Planning and Research of NEMA, Kayode Fagbemi, said the donation was an intervention by the federal government to the displaced persons.

Also speaking, Senator Gyunka called on the federal government to beef up security in the affected community to enable the displaced persons go back to their places of abode and continue with their farming activities. Gyunka expressed worries that the entire Andaha community was in trauma as a result of the unprovoked attack on them by the suspected Fulani herdsmen.
