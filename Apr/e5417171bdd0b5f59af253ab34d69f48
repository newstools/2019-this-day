 The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has debunked the notion that he was Cameroonian by birth and thus not qualified to contest the presidential election.
Atiku, who was born in Jada in 1946, in Adamawa State, said he was born by Nigerian parents and, therefore, “a citizen of Nigeria by birth.”
