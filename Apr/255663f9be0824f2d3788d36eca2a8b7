The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) is set to hold a roundtable on Nigeria’s regulatory environment and its impact on businesses viz-a-viz the economy. This move, according to the Chamber, is aimed at examining activities of the regulatory agencies in the country as well as strengthening the relations between the private sector and these agencies of government. The roundtable, according to LCCI, is scheduled to hold tomorrow, at Victoria Island, Lagos. The Director General of the LCCI, Muda Yusuf, said: “The regulatory environment is a critical factor in the ease of doing business. Engagement of the regulatory institutions has become imperative because of their role and impact on the quality of the business environment. “We need to engage these institutions in order to deepen communication and dialogue in the context of pushing private partnership. We seek regulatory institutions that are investment friendly and that would complement the efforts of the private sector to create wealth and generate employment.” Yusuf further stressed that, “the event hopes to have in attendance the leadership of key regulatory agencies such as the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also expected are Consumer Protection Council (CPC) and Nigeria Customs Service (NCS).
