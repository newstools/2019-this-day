Super Eagles goalkeeper Francis Uzoho received the first red card of his career in the 23rd minute of Anorthosis’s 3-0 home win over Alki Oroklinis in the Cypriot top league on Monday Uzoho was given his marching orders for unsportsmanlike conduct, shortly after Anorthosis had scored their second goal of the game. The Deportivo de La Coruña player on loan at the Cyprus club was dismissed after he gave the middle finger to a section of the Alki Oroklinis supporters who racially insulted him. ”He was repeatedly challenged with racist comments and with monkey sounds, he first showed his dissatisfaction to the fans without causing them, but they went ahead and continued with taunts,” Panikos Theodosiou revealed, according to Goal Cyprus. ”The player apologizes to the rest of the fans and his team. But it is time to start in Cyprus to punish the actors rather than the victims, especially when we have to face racist attitudes.” On Tuesday, the management of Alki Oroklinis stated that preliminary investigations conducted suggests that there was no racist attack on Uzoho and they are determined to remove such behaviors from the stadiums if this is proven.
