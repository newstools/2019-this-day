The government of Sri Lanka has imposed an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew on Colombo, following the Easter day bombings of churches and hotels that has so far claimed over 290 lives. Government information department disclosed this on Tuesday. More than 500 people were injured in the Easter Sunday assault that saw suicide bombers hit three high-end hotels popular with foreign tourists and three churches, unleashing carnage in Colombo and beyond. Two additional blasts were triggered as security forces carried out raids searching for suspects. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police said Monday 24 people had been arrested, over the country’s worst attacks for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan police have arrested two dozen people in connection with a string of bomb attacks on several churches and hotels that have claimed the lives of at least 290 people. The country went on lockdown on Easter Sunday after eight apparently coordinated blasts hit churches filled with worshipers as well as luxury hotels in the capital Colombo, and the cities of Negombo and Batticaloa. Police announced the dramatic rise in the death toll on Monday morning, saying some 500 people had also been injured in the attacks, the worst of their kind since the end of Sri Lanka’s devastating civil war a decade ago. There were 32 foreigners among those killed, including nationals from Britain, the United States, Turkey, India, China, Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal. Three police officers were also killed several hours after the attack, when they raided a house in Colombo. Police reported an explosion at the house. (NAN)
