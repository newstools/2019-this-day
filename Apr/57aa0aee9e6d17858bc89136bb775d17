His display of honesty, sincerity of purpose, respect for divergent views, loyalty to and believe in party supremacy as well as proven experience in the business of lawmaking makes him the obvious choice for the legislature’s top job” the three senators said in a statement made available to newsmen in Minna. “It is therefore our belief and hope that the Presidency of Distinguished Senator Lawan at the 9th Senate will also bring about the transformation of our dear Niger State even as we look forward to sponsoring bills that will benefit the good people of the state.
