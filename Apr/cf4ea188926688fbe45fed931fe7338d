UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Tottenham ended Manchester City’s quadruple bid as Fernando Llorente’s goal settled a see-sawing free-scoring Champions League quarter-final. The game began at a frantic pace with five goals inside 21 minutes as Raheem Sterling and Son Heung-Min both scored twice and Bernardo Silva found the net. Sergio Aguero’s goal after the break put City ahead in the tie, but Llorente bundled in to put his side back ahead. In a dramatic late twist Sterling saw an injury-time winner ruled out by centre referee Cüneyt Çakir after consulting the VAR. Spurs will play Ajax in the last four. In the other game of the night, goals from Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah set Liverpool on their way to a thumping 6-1 aggregate win over Porto as they eased into the Champions League semi-finals. Leading 2-0 from the first leg at Anfield, Liverpool were forced to survive an early bombardment in the saturated Estadio do Dragao before taking control. Mane opened the scoring with a sliding effort – from Mohamed Salah’s scuffed shot – which was confirmed by VAR, before Salah stroked in a second after the break from a superb counter-attack. Real Madrid-bound defender Eder Militao pulled a goal back for the hosts before close-range headers from Roberto Firmino and Virgil van Dijk sealed an impressive victory. Liverpool will face Barcelona in the first leg of their semi-final at the Nou Camp on Tuesday 30 April.
