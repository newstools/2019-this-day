Monday letter2 It is now over after a strenuous journey, suspense and anxiety with the declaration by Independent National Electoral Commission of Alhaji
Ahmadu Umaru Fintri as the Governor-elect of Adamawa State based on the votes he secured after the
supplementary election conducted in the 14 Local Government Areas of the state.
He garnered 376,552 votes to beat the incumbent Governor Muhammad Umaru Bindow, who polled 336,386 votes. The road was rough for Alhaji Fintri, but he was once
was tested when he acted as governor of Adamawa State when the then Governor Murtala Nyako was impeached. The people of the state placed their hopes on him especially the civil servants who are finding it almost impossible to get their gratuities once they retire.
His election was inspired by hope, the
people see him as a dedicated person that can do anything to shape their destiny.
He ran a robust campaign, crisscrossed the state and spoke about the cardinal objectives and motives behind
his aspiration for Dougerei Government House. And the people wholeheartedly accepted him more especially the civil servants.
He promised to offset the burden of parents by paying NECO and WASSCE fees for their wards.
He also promised to pay retiring civil servants their benefits
and at the same time clear their outstanding liabilities of gratuities. He walked the path of honour by giving the people the much desired dividends of democracy within a period of three months when he acted as governor. That singular
honour endeared him to a lot of people, more especially the civil servants. They overwhelmingly went to the poll by voting for him in both the election and the supplementary elections. Usman Santuraki, Jimeta, Yola
