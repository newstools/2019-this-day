Making the revelation during the sixth matriculation of its new students on Tuesday, the institution’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Sani Mohammad Dangoggo, also said 200 members of staff of the institution have been sponsored to pursue post graduate programmes in and outside the country. He said while administering matriculation oaths to 2,074 undergraduate students for 2018/2019 academic session, that the students cut across the Faculty of Art/Social Science, Faculty of Science and Faculty of Education. He further stated that 13,000 candidates applied for admission in the university for 2018/2019 academic session but 2,074 were lucky to be admitted.
