Super Eagles Head Coach, Gernot Rohr is worried over one of the players, Samuel Kalu who is battling to be fit for the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt after suffering a relapse from an injury which he has nursed for two months and half. According to Owngoalnigeria.com, Kalu is yet to play for Bordeaux the past three weeks and he is not close to returning for the team due to the injury set back, which according to Rohr became worse after he tried to force his return back to action in a league game against Monaco on the 9th of March, a game he ended up playing just 29 minutes. The Franco-German coach revealed that Kalu’s family issues particularly when his mother was kidnapped for ransom also aggravated the injury as the 21 year old didn’t sleep for nights in his bid to secure the release of his mother from her abductors. He rounded up by saying he is however hopeful that the forward will play for Bordeaux once again this season and also prove his fitness on time for the Africa Cup of Nations because he is a very important player to the senior national team of Nigeria. ” It’s an elongation at the limit of a small tear. He wanted to resume a little too fast ‎, so he forced it and with the fatigue accumulated by the anxiety for his mother who was kidnapped, he had sleepless nights which further aggravated the injury “, Rohr said. ” Bordeaux has shown lot of understanding and have been helpful to him. The injury halted his progress but I am sure he will bring something more when he returns because he is also key to our plans for the Africa Cup of Nations “.
