The lawmaker said: “Yes, I can confirm to you that four of our people, including a security personnel, were killed during the incident. Many were also wounded. We have also counted at least 44 houses that were completely burnt down by the attackers. “It was the heavily-armed Fulani people numbering over 300 that came to attack our people. I am going to present the issue as a matter of urgent public importance before the House of Assembly members when we convene today because this thing cannot be allowed to continue. “The invasion started around 12.noon on Monday and did not stop until more than four hours. I was in touch with the Commander of the STF in charge of security in the state and he assured me he was going to mobilise his men to quell the situation. I was then surprised at the extent of destruction that eventually occurred in the community.” A source from the assembly said that a committee would be set up by the lawmakers on how to resolve the lingering crisis of herdsmen attacks in the state.
