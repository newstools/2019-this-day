Goddy Egene The stock market declined by 2.05 per cent last week as events in the capital market community dampened investors’ appetite. Although the market opened for only three days due to two days holiday declared by the federal government, some analysts said regulatory action against Oando Plc by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the protest by some workers of the commission, opposing the expected return of its suspended director general, Mr. Mounir Gwarzo, impacted the market negatively. Contrary to a growth of 0.61 per cent the previous week, the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NSE ASI) fell 2.05 per cent to close at 30,432.13, while market capitalisation shed N283.2 billion to close at N13.402 trillion. At the beginning of the week on Monday, the local bourse depreciated by 0.45 per cent mostly on the back of losses by Seplat, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, When trading resumed on Thursday, sell pressure in Dangote Cement Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and United Bank for Africa Plc depressed the index by 1.3 per cent. The bear run continued on Friday, leading to a decline of 0.31 per cent. As a result, the NSE ASI dipped by 2.05 per cent for the week. Across the sectors tracked, the performance was negative throughout.

The NSE Industrial Goods Index went down by 3.1 per cent, while the NSE Banking Index shed 3.1 per cent, just as the NSE Consumer Goods Index closed 1.2 per cent lower. However, some market analysts said the sacking of the Group Chief Executive Officer of Oando Plc, Mr. Wale Tinubu and his deputy. Mr. Omamofe Boyo, following the release of the forensic audit of the company’s activities and the events that followed discouraged some investors from the market last week. Following   the conclusion of investigations into the activities of Oando Plc, having received petitions from two shareholders in 2017, that the company was being mismanaged, SEC  barred Tinubu and Boyo  from being  directors in any public company for the next five years. The commission also directed board members found guilty of various infractions to resign. SEC  also announced the constitution of an Interim Management Team (IMT) headed by Mr. Mutiu Sunmonu, to oversee the affairs of Oando Plc and conduct an Extra Ordinary General Meeting on or before July 1, 2019. But Tinubu and Boyo got   an ex-parte motion  order from the  Federal High Court in Lagos presided over by Justice Mojisola Olatoregun restraining SEC from implementing the  directives contained in the outcome of the forensic audit. The judge said the order to maintain the status quo would remain pending the determination of the motion on notice. But SEC  requested the deployment of armed security personnel , who took over   Oando Plc’s  office in Lagos for days. Assessing the situation, the Chief Research Officer, Investdata, Ambrose Omordion, said there was already a panicky mode, as investors watch developments in the market According to him, Oando’s decision to seek court protection on Monday, restraining the implementation of the SEC’s order, and the appointment of Mutiu Sunmonu, as head of the Interim Management Committee without doubts, would further dampened investors’ confidence. Omordion explained that the market would remain volatile   in the absence of any catalyst that would impact positively on the market, and raise investor appetite for equity. “However, we would like to reiterate our advice that investors should go for equity with intrinsic value. We advise investors to allow numbers to guide their decisions, while repositioning in any stock, especially now that stock prices remain low in the midst of mixed company numbers, weak economic and market fundamentals.” Market turnover Meanwhile, market turnover fell significantly because it was a  brief trading week  following federal government’s  declaration of Tuesday and Wednesday  as  public holidays to mark the end of holy month of Ramadan and commemorate the Eid al-Fitr celebrations.
