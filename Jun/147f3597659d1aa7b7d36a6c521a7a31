By Bennett  Oghifo Mercedes-Benz sold 195,690 vehicles worldwide in May (-1.3%). The sales success of the new A-Class and the new CLA Coupé, which was launched in Europe in May, had a positive effect last month.

We are very confident that the significant sales momentum from our model offensive will be reflected in the second half of the year, particularly with the SUVs,” said Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. “The third month in a row with worldwide growth in sales of Mercedes-Benz compact cars demonstrates the strong demand for our new models. We are very pleased with the excellent feedback, especially from our younger customers, on the launch of the new CLA Coupé in Europe, on the new A-Class and on our MBUX multimedia system.” Mercedes-Benz unit sales by region and market This May, deliveries in Europe were above the high level of the prior-year month: 81,762 Mercedes-Benz vehicles were sold in the region (+0.9%).
