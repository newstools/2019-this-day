He waved to the fans, who gave him a rousing reception on his first day, before he showed off with some keepy-uppies and tricks to the delight of fans. Hazard was then urged to kiss the badge and he duly obliged which created the loudest cheer of his unveiling. Having earlier admitted his Spanish is not yet up to scratch, he kept his message on the pitch brief. The Belgian said: ‘Thank you all very much. Hala Madrid!’ Before the fans saw him in person, he conducted a short briefing alongside Real President Florentino Perez where each of them described their delight at the deal being finalised. Wearing a pristine grey suit, Hazard sat down next to Perez and his family for the presentation. Broadcast on Real Madrid TV, the Belgian said: ‘I am going to speak in French, I still need to improve my Spanish. ‘I am looking forward to putting on this shirt and defending the shirt. As the president said, it was a dream to play for this club and now I am here.’ Perez added: ‘You are where you wanted to be – this was one of your dreams. Now one of your dreams has come true. ‘This will be your home and you will feel and experience great passion. From day one you will realise the most important thing here is the fans, those who love Real Madrid. ‘To play for this club was your biggest dream and thanks to your hard work and talent you have joined Real. The fans will be behind you in every game. The fans know you are unique and your brand of football is special.’ The Belgian passed his medical earlier in the day before his official unveiling at night. The Belgium star became the club’s record-signing when his move from Chelsea was finally concluded last Friday.
