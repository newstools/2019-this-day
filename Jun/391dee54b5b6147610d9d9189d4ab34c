The crisis between Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi ll, has been resolved following a reconciliatory meeting between the two in Abuja.
This is contained in a statement by Mr Abba Anwar, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Ganduje and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Saturday. According to Anwar, the reconciliatory meeting was initiated by the Kano born business mogul Alhaji Aliko Dangote and the Chairman of Nigeria’s Governors’ Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi. He said after the meeting, the duo exchanged pleasantries with each other in Abuja on Friday. “As the two leaders met, they congratulated each other for the successful completion of the Ramadan Fast and the Eid-el-Fitr celebration. “Both leaders spoke and urged all Muslims to continue with the good teachings and spirit of the Fasting period of the Month of Ramadan. “Emir Sanusi seized the opportunity to congratulate Gov. Ganduje for the victory in his second term in office. He also wished the governor successful tenure in office.” According to the statement, the two agreed that “for healthier relationship between the two institutions of government and Kano Emirate Council, the dialogues will continue.” NAN recalls that the Kano State Government on Thursday queried the Sanusi over alleged misappropriation of N3.4bn by the Kano Emirate Council. The state government had also created four emirates out of Kano. (NAN)
