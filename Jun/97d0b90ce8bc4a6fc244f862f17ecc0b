In the second attack on Monday, the insurgents were alleged to have attacked a village in Guzamala Local Government Area of the troubled state, the birthplace of Boko Haram, killing nine persons and carting away food stuffs and livestock. A chieftain of the Civilian Joint Task Force in Borno State, Abba-Aji Kalli, confirmed the attack.
