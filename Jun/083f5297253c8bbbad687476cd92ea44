At Akwa yesterday, Dangote Group compensated the victims of the accident NEM Insurance Plc, an insurance company engaged to settle damages caused by any of the company’s heavy duty trucks across the country. Addressing the delegation through his deputy, the state governor, Mr. Willie Obiano, commended Dangote Group for compensating the victims of the accidents.
Unlike before when the company’s drivers are known to run away from accident scenes, leaving their victims to bear their loss alone, the governor said the company had stood by the victims and compensated them. Obiano, therefore, encouraged the beneficiaries to judiciously use the money given to them, noting however that no amount of money can replace their lost loved ones or properties.
Obiano called on the company to device means of giving back to society, noting that Anambra was also one of the major patrons of the company’s products in the country, especially its brand of cement. Before the presentation of cheques, a representative of the insurance company, Mr. Kolawole Lateef commended the state government and the victims of the accident for amicably settling with the company without involving the courts.
He consoled the affected persons, especially those that lost their loved ones to the incident.
