Ejiofor Alike The Presidency last night commended the ruling of the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal that turned down the request of the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the February 23, 2019 election for the inspection of the server allegedly used for the election. The Presidency in a statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu in Abuja, described the ruling as a mark of triumph of justice over propaganda. According to the statement, “In a landmark ruling by the Presidential Election Tribunal, a desperate attempt by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to overreach judicial process was overwhelmingly rejected by a unanimous decision and the long standing principle of law has once again been re-enacted. “An attempt to cause the determination of an issue that constitutes the fulcrum of contention between the parties, at an interlocutory stage, has again been rejected by the tribunal. “What this means is that Justice and fair hearing through due contest by the parties of a major issue for determination remains sacrosanct and remains considerable by the tribunal upon according parties just and fair hearing and not the other way round. “The election petitions tribunal unanimously rejected the PDP’s request to inspect a server which existence is being disputed. “The existence of a purported server is being contested and if a purported inspection had been allowed at this stage, it would have amounted to the determination that it indeed existed even when its existence is being contested. “The electoral law prescribes manual transmission of results only and this was what the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did, in obedience to the law as witnessed by real electoral observers. “YIAGA Africa deployed 3,906 real individuals to run a parallel tabulation which returned the same results the INEC announced. “Last week, the final reports of the International Republican Institute and National Democratic Institute (IRI/NDI) electoral observer mission made clear that the results of the election reflected the votes cast. “President Muhammadu Buhari won with a majority of four million votes and because only real votes matter, INEC announced him as the winner of the 2019 presidential election.”
