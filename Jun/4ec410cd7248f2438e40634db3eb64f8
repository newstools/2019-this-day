This partnership aims specifically to digitise criminal records and provide a web portal for an online automated system of background checks and issuance of criminal records clearance certificate. This project is to be operated by AoS as a business, and will make the process of background checks and issuance of clearance certificates automated, seamless, credible, and affordable for everyone and every legal entity.
