The SA to the governor said ESIPO recently visited two top-ranking investment promotion agencies (IPA) in the country to compare notes and strengthen drive for investments, noting, “We were at Lagos Global, a top-rated IPA with the highest FDI attraction in Nigeria. We also visited KADIPA, which ranks as number one by the World Bank on the Ease of Doing Business index in Nigeria.” He said the state government was partnering with the Market Development in the Niger Delta (MADE), a United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID)-funded programme, to improve the investment climate in the state.

The special assistant added that there was need for cooperation among IPAs in the country, which would enhance adoption of investment promotion models that have been proven to work and successful, noting that, “Nigeria has what it takes to compete with other countries for FDIs and Edo State is working to be among the top destinations for investors.”
