Vice Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 elections, Mr. Peter Obi has washed his hands off a fraudulent empowerment scheme advertised in the social media by scammers using a fake Peter Obi account. A statement by Obi’s Media Adviser, Mr. Valentine Obienyem said “The fake Peter Obi Facebook account announced a non-existent “EMPOWERMENT SCHEME”, saying: “Nigeria’s federal government has sponsored all Nigerian top politicians to empower all Nigerian citizens with a minimum of # 400,000 to #1,000,000 to help them get good education and startup businesses. If you are a Nigerian citizen, do not let this opportunity exclude you. To be a beneficiary contact or WhatsApp Hon. Sharibu on 09069383539. Obienyem said “: “This is false and has nothing to do with Mr. Peter Obi.” He advised the public to ignore the fake post and to alert their friends and relatives “to avoid some people falling prey to the machination of evil men.”
