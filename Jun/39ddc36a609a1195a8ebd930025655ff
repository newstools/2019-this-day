I’m more than ready to make history on the 28th of July and I’ll ensure this event will be talked about for several years, get your tickets!” Since inception, The Oxymoron of Kenny Blaq has proven to be one of the best events in Nigeria receiving the best comedy show of the year at Naija FM Comedy Awards in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
