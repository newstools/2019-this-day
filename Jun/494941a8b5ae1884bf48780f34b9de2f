Other notable speakers are Professor Afe Adogame of Princeton Theological Seminary and Professor Chima Korieh of Marquette University, Wisconsin, USA.

Falola will show how Kalu created many ideas of his own that involved the “unsung heroes” from five perspectives which are his account of the African agency is what makes his work so revolutionary and significant”. He explained further that the late Professor Kalu was one of the world’s seminal scholars, focusing mostly on African Christianity, Global Missions, and Global Pentecostalism. Kalu argued that, historically, African Christianity grew out of African cosmology and primal religion.
