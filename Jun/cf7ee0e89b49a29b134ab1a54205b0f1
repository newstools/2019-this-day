Egypt’s former president Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the army in 2013, has died in court, state TV says. He reportedly fainted after a court session where he was facing espionage charges and subsequently died. He was 67. Morsi was overthrown following mass protests a year after he took office as the country’s first democratically elected leader. (BBC)
