Fifty pupils have emerged winners at the just concluded Kellogg’s Superstar Contest. The competition  was put together by Kellogg Tolaram LFTZ Enterprise, an indigenous cereal manufacturer,  which according to the company, was designed for primary school pupils to sharpen their writing skills and  bring out the creative ingenuity in them.
