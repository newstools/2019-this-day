By Alex Enumah in Abuja The Supreme Court on Monday reserved judgment till July 5 in the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) suit challenging the election of the All Progressives Congress’ (APC) Gboyega Oyetola as governor of Osun State. A seven-man panel of justices of the apex court presided over by the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Muhammad, announced the date after the counsel in the matter adopted and argued their brief of argument in the matter.
