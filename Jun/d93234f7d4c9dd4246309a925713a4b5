What happens on YouTube is a reflection of what is important and relevant to the world. YouTube has a large and passionate community where people gather and express themselves, share experiences, and reflect on what they think about and care about moment to moment. “We’re very excited, this week, to bring YouTube’s Creator community and fans together to share, learn and celebrate YouTube and the Nigerian Creators who are taking our culture to the world.” D’Banj’s ‘Adventures of KokoMaster’ series was also premiered at the event. The festival also provided a week-long bootcamp for creators where topics like channel and content strategy, working with brands, creator responsibility, production, and accelerating growth on YouTube were plumbed. A public YouTube Masterclass will be held on Saturday, for registered participants.
