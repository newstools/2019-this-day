Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari for branding residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja as “necessary evil” because they did not vote for him in the February 23 presidential election. The party said that such resort to branding of Nigerians for rightly exercising their rights is completely ‘’unpresidential’’ and must be condemned by all. The PDP said that the statement was inciting, divisive and capable of demonising innocent compatriots and setting them up for victimisation by overzealous agencies. “President Buhari should note that he was not only rejected by FCT residents but also by an overwhelming majority of Nigerians across the states of the federation, who voted massively for the PDP, only for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to subvert the will of the people in his favour. ‘’Consequent upon which our party and presidential candidate have headed for the retrieval of this stolen mandate at the tribunal.” The opposition party also criticised President Buhari for stating that “to make FCT secure is to make myself secure and the vice president’’, stating that it is the duty of the President to provide security for all parts of the country, irrespective of where he and the vice president reside or how Nigerians cast their
votes. PDP maintained that the security of lives of all Nigerians ought to have been paramount to the president and not determined by inessential factors, if indeed he has the interest of the people at heart. It therefore called on President Buhari to apologise to Nigerians for this divisive comment. The party also urged Nigerians to continue in their determination to retrieve the stolen presidential mandate at the tribunal, so as to have an administration that truly cares for the citizens, in line with the provisions of our laws.
