Udora Orizu in Abuja The Nasarawa State Universal Basic Education Board (NSUBEC) has responded to a Freedom of Information (FoI) request by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), disclosing how “the government spent Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) funds on primary school education between 2015 and 2019 including spending N45 million in one week to train one thousand primary school teachers.” This was disclosed in a statement by SERAP’s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare. The government’s response followed FOI requests SERAP sent last month to NSUBEB, UBEC and other 35 state universal basic education boards, seeking details of spending on primary education across the country, given the poor state of education in many states of the federation. In the letter with reference number NS/UBEB/S/OFF-69/VOL.I/XX and signed by the Board Secretary Yakubu Ahmed Ubangari, on behalf of the Executive Chairman, the Nasarawa State Education Board disclosed that, “Our counterpart fund for primary education in 2015 was N866,756,76, while the matching grant was N876,756,756,76. In 2016, our counterpart fund was N607,848,100.48 while the matching grant was N607,849,100.48. The total fund we accessed in 2015 was N1,753,513,513.52.
