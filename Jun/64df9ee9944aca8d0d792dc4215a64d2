It also charged its members and allies all over Nigeria not to engage in any panicky measures over the growing insecurity and tension in the country.

It is for this reason that we have tasked PRONACO Action Group with the urgent effort of mobilising a broad pan Nigerian structures towards a joint national action against the threatening insecurity in our country “…..Our Intervention can not be separatist or sectional in nature but collectivised, pan Nigerian and formidable as endangered Peoples within the Nigerian contraption. So by June 19th, we shall all have to move together as one force to rescue our land from the grip of marauders and invaders.” The Director General of the third force Movement in Nigeria however hinted that the Chairman of PRONACO Action Group, PRAG, Alhaji Shetimma Yerima, and his Secretary, Mr Bright Ezeocha, had been mandated to put together a broad national consultation with identified allied Leaders of the people, some of whom will be honoured on June 12 for their past sacrifices for the cause of Democracy in Nigeria A tentative list drawn for PRAG’s pan Nigerian consultative engagement by Nigeria Political Summit Group, NPSG, according to the Movement includes, Prof Wole Soyinka, Gen TY Danjuma, Prof Ben Nwabueze, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Chief Reuben Fashoranti, Chief Edwin Clark, Chief Olu Falae, Gen Zamani Lekwot, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Prof Ango Abdullahi, General Alani Akinriade, Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu, Alhaji Ahmed Joda, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, Chief Bisi Akande, Gen Ike Nwachukwu, Alhaji Sule Hamma, and Prof Kinse Okoko.
