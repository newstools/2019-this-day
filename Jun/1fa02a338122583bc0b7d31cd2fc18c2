The presiding justice of the five-man panel, Justice Mohammed Garba, in a ruling held that granting of the application would imply that the court has delved into and resolved the contentious issue of the existence of a central server at INEC. The chairman added that doing so would further create the impression that the tribunal has concluded that there is a central server where results of the February 23 election were received and stored. The tribunal had on June 13 reserved ruling in the application filed by Atiku and PDP on May 8, for access to inspect INEC’s central server and smart card reader allegedly used in the conduct of the February 23 presidential election.
