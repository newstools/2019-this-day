The role of Association of Corporate and Marketing Professionals of Banks (ACAMB) in providing strategic initiatives to redefine the image of the Banking industry that resonates with customers has been emphasised. Speaking at an engagement session during a recent meeting with officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and ACAMB’s Exco, the Director of Corporate Communications of the central bank, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, observed that the increasing synergy between CBN and ACAMB would be beneficial in championing new ideas to properly manage the image of the Banking industry as a potent vehicle for promoting financial systems stability. Pledging the support of CBN to ACAMB, a statement from the corporate affairs managers’ association quoted Okorafor to have highlighted frequently reoccurring customer feedbacks that have continued to form perceptions around the banking industry such as appropriate pricing and bank charges, adding that continuous customer engagement would help clarify misconceptions. The regulator’s spokesperson used the opportunity to inform ACAMB Exco of the objectives of various funding intervention initiatives of CBN such as NIRSAL, Agribusiness, Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme, among others, being operated to enable many people get access to funding to stabilise the economy.
