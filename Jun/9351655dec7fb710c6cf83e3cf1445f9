With Betway’s latest Win Boost feature, Nigerian sports fans who place Multi Bets on major sporting events can now smile all the way to the bank. Commenting on the new feature, Betway Country Manager, Lere Awokoya, said, “We are thrilled about the Win Boost offer because it gives bettors the opportunity to boost their Multi Bet winnings up to 250%. “At Betway, the goal is to make sure that our customers have multiple options when they visit our platform, and with the addition of this feature, the odds of winning are much higher.” Win Boost, which was recently launched on betway.com.ng, will give betters the chance to increase their multi bet payouts by up to 250%. This means that Betway will increase the payout amounts on winnings on Multi Bets for all customers who register and bet through the platform. To qualify for a boost, bettors will be required to place a Multi Bet consisting of five or more legs, each at odds of 1.2 or more. The more legs added to the betslip, the bigger the boost. As a global leader in online sports betting, Betway has been working tirelessly to meet the needs of its customers through features and promotions that are geared to Nigerians and their love for sports. Betway, Principal sponsors of English Premier League side West Ham United, continues to stay true to its promise of providing the best sports betting opportunities for Nigerian sports fans through new and existing features like 4 To Score, Book-a-Bet, Lucky Numbers and more.
