To remove the cause of hardship and replacing despair with hope, fear with human security and humiliation with dignity”. He said.  Others who spoke at the occasion were village heads of Gudum Fulani, Malam Umar Abdullahi; Gudum Hausawa, Malam Musa Mato, and a Christian cleric, Reverend Ezekiel Abasu Gwandun.  They identified youth restiveness,  immorality, and drug abuse as root causes of violence in the society, calling on government to create jobs and tasked parents on proper upbringing of their children.
