Analysis of the budgetary provisions for the programmes reveals that out of an annual approved budget of N500 billion, only N470, 825,522,694.62 (31 percent) was released for three budget cycles of 2016, 2017 and 2018. For the three years, the budget should have been N1.5 trillion. In 2016, only N79, 985,158,705.32 was made available for the programme out of the N500 billion appropriated while in 2017 N140, 000,000,000.00 was released.

Apparently appalled by the level of poverty in the north, she criticized the Social Investment Programme (SIP) of her husband’s administration, saying there was little evidence to show that a good chunk of its budget was judiciously utilised. According to her, the initiative has failed to reach its intended beneficiaries in at least Adamawa and Kano. However, the Special Adviser to the President on Social Investments, Mrs Maryam Uwais has defended the what the programme had been able to achieve so far. She nevertheless agreed that the program could have achieved more had there been more funds. She said: “I believe we could do so much more if we have sufficient funding. We have only scratched the surface in the sense that we do not have the sufficient funding to address.”
