Lionel Messi has been snapped celebrating a sixth Ballon d’Or alongside his Barcelona teammates, with the La Liga champions reportedly confident the Argentinian will renew his contract. The 32-year-old had clinched the coveted trophy once again on Monday, and toasted his victory alongside Antoine Griezmann and Marc-Andre ter Stegen on the flight back from France. And Messi is reportedly on the verge of further good news, as Mundo Deportivo report that Barcelona believe the superstar is open to extending his stay at the Nou Camp. Messi had fended off firm competition from Liverpool stalwart Virgil van Dijk to win the award with Cristiano Ronaldo, who snubbed the ceremony, finishing in third spot. The superstar pipped the Dutchman to the top spot by just seven votes, and was also supported by his wife Antonello at the star-studded event in Paris. In the wake of yet another accolade, the Spanish publication highlighted that Messi has the choice to terminate his contract next year, as stipulated in his current deal, but holds no desire to leave the club. President Josep Bartomeu had previously stressed that Messi’s priority is to remain with the top flight giants, and the club’s hierarchy are keen to secure the star’s future in Catalonia. There are concerns, however, that Messi only wants to remain with Barcelona for as long as he is able to compete at the highest level, and the Argentinian is believed to not be focused on battling for the sake of his career or record at the top of the game. The same outlet also understand that the mercurial forward wishes to avoid the same fate as idol Ronaldinho, who had endured a sharp decline in the latter stages of his career at the club. Bartomeu has reportedly taken charge of negotiations surrounding Messi’s potential renewal and is the main point of contact for the player’s agent.
