The Committee Chairman, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, who gave the directive at an investigative hearing, also directed the Human Rights Commission, office of the Chief Judge of Federal High Court and presiding judge of the ‘invaded’ court, Justice Ijeoma, to submit their memo over the alleged invasion on before close of work on Friday.
