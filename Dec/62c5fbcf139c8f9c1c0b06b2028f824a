 The insurgents were also said to have injured three other persons in villages a few kilometres from Chibok, where they first gained their notoriety with the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls a few years ago. The Borno State Commissioner for Poverty Alleviation, Mr. Nuhu Clark, an indigene of the area, told the governor of the attack. Clark told journalists in Maiduguri on Wednesday that the insurgents invaded the village early Tuesday evening just about the time for the Islamic sunset prayer time, around 6pm. He said they shot sporadically, burnt down a primary school and carted away a large quantity of food stuff stored in a church premises, among others. Reacting, the Borno Governor, Prof. Babagana Umara, expressed condolence to the entire people of Chibok Local Government Area over  the sad attack on Christmas eve. The governor, who called on the people to continue to pray for peace and stability in the state, noted that without peace and stability, there would be no development and progress.
