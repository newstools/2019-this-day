World chess champion Magnus Carlsen has climbed to an astonishing sixth place in the Premier League Fantasy Football rankings. Carlsen has dominated the world of chess for around a decade now, but it seems he also flourishes in the world of fantasy football. The Norwegian’s team, named Kjell Ankedal, has risen to sixth out of 7 million players worldwide after a gameweek where captaining Mohamed Salah against Bournemouth paid off with a 26-point return. Carlsen’s team also featured standout weekend performers Son Heung-min, who scored a wonderful solo goal against Burnley, and Jamie Vardy who scored for the eighth Premier League game running. The 29-year-old is a known lover of Premier League football, and is often seen kicking a ball about before chess tournaments worldwide. He is currently in London competing at the London Chess Classic at Olympia.
