Chuks Okocha in Abuja The spokesperson to the former Military President, General Ibrahim B. Babangida (IBB), Kassim Afegbua has dispelled reports that the former military president is dead. He said that IBB as he is popularly called is “alive and bubbling”. Afegbua made the clarification Sunday in a statement to debunk rumours about the former president’s death. An online report had claimed the former military leader had died. Dispelling the rumour, Afegbua said, ”It has become consistent fake news for quite some time now wishing our own IBB, the one we easily refer to as “the last don” of Nigeria politics, dead. The “fake news bill” would be a suitable response to this category of fake news carrier. IBB is very much alive and bubbling. He just started attending to friends and associates who came to see him today, Sunday, 15th December, 2019 right here at his Minna Hilltop mansion. He is full of life and in his characteristic bubbling mood”, Afegbua said. . The spokesperson of the former military president further stated. “May Allah forgive those who wish IBB dead. God is the giver and taker of life, not humans. Death, as the irrevocable end of all creation, will surely come to everyone some day and at the appointed time and hour, but to deliberately spread fake news and wish someone dead, is to take humanity to another bizarre level. “May Allah forgive them. IBB, by the special grace of Allah, the omniscient and omnipotent One, shall live to fulfill his journey and destiny in life, to the consternation of those who are always wishing him dead. This is about the third time this year”. Afegbua thanked all those who took time off to clarify than carrying fake news, adding, “We wish to thank those who took time to reach out to us, home and abroad, to find out the truth. We thank you all for your love, care and concern. May Allah grant us all good health, sound mind and long life. Amin.”
