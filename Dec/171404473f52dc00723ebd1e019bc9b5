The Plateau command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has deployed 2,000 men and officers for a crime free and peaceful yuletide in the state. Mr Obasa Tanimola, the Commandâ€™s Public Relations Officer (PRO), made this known in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Jos. According to him, most of the officers and men have been stationed within Jos-Bukuru metropolis. He said others were located at strategic places, such as recreational and worship centres and motor parks, to forestall any breach of law and order. Tanimola pointed that the personnel were also to help control traffic, as heavy vehicular and human traffic usually occurred during the yuletide. He revealed that the 2,000 officers and men consisted of both uniformed and non-uniformed personnel. He said the officials would work in synergy with other security agencies in the state. The PRO called on parents to caution their children and wards to desist from any act that could breach the peace in the state. He also called on residents to go about their legitimate businesses and to report any suspicious movement, either by groups or individuals, to NSCDC or other security agencies for prompt response. The PRO said that the command had secured 54 arrests, 17 convicted persons and had 26 on-going court cases from January till date. (NAN)
