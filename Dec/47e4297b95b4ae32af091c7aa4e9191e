 Martins Ifijeh The Director General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Christiana Adeyeye has warned business owners involved in sharp practices of revalidating expired rice and repackaging local rice as foreign to desist from the act. In a statement made available to THISDAY recently, she called on Nigerians to be vigilant, and exercise discretion when purchasing rice and other food items. “NAFDAC is fully alive to her responsibilities of assuring the safety, wholesomeness and quality of foods and other regulated products offered for sale to the public.” She said the Ogun State office of NAFDAC received a report from the Department of State Services (DSS) in the state, of ongoing food fraud at Oke-Aje market in Ijebu Ode. “We, in company of men of the Nigeria Police Force proceeded to the scene of the illegal activity. On arrival, the suspected perpetrators of the food fraud instigated unnamed persons to unleash mayhem on the team of investigators. “However, enforcement officers of the agency and its Federal Task Force team stormed the market in company of DSS officials. They sighted miscreants at the market who took to their heels. “Bags of expired rice, caked rice, bags of local rice, bags of popular foreign rice and sealing machines were found in the shops the NAFDAC enforcement team finally gained access into. “Three shops were sealed during the operation. It is instructive to note that expired and caked rice are unwholesome as they contain moulds and microorganism that cause diseases which are of immense public health concern.” She called on Nigerians to report cases of re-bagging and sale of caked and expired rice or other food items to the nearest NAFDAC office across the federation.
