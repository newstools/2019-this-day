Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha believes the club should go all out to sign Edinson Cavani from French league leaders Paris Saint-Germain in the January transfer window. United have endured an inconsistent start to the season but recorded an impressive 2-1 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford on Wednesday night. Saha believes an extra addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s strikeforce would galvanise the attack due to the extra competition. Speaking to bwin, Saha said: ‘Manchester United are the Premier League team that need to strengthen the most in January and they should look at signing Edinson Cavani from PSG. ‘They need to bring in players to challenge the existing players and create competition; Cavani would push Rashford and Martial and make them even better. ‘Sir Alex [Ferguson] didn’t like signing players in the January transfer window but times are different now; United need to strengthen sooner rather than later. “I would love to see Cavani join the Premier League; he would be a great signing for Manchester United. “I’d also love to see Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho or Barcelona’s Samuel Umtiti; they would both fit right into the Premier League.’ The 32-year-old Cavani has only played 10 times for PSG so far this season and has scored twice. United, meanwhile, are sixth in the Premier League with 21 points from 15 games. They are eight points behind Chelsea in fourth.
