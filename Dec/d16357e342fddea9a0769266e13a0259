President Muhammadu Buhari mourned the death of Kano businessman, Alhaji Tijjani Rabiu. In a statement issued yesterday by his media aide, Garba Shehu,  Buhari described the death of Tijjani , the immediate younger brother of the late tycoon, Isyaku Rabiu, as “the fall of another star in the galaxy of commerce and trade in Northern Nigeria.” Reacting to the passage of Tijjani yesterday, the President noted that “the deceased belonged to a business dynasty that has become famous since the birth of modern Nigeria and who has achieved business successes through sheer hard work and determination.” He praised Tijjani for “following the enviable path of his older brother Isyaku Rabiu who remained relevant in a tough competitive environment, despite the passage of time.” According to the President , “the Rabius are not only a family of accomplished business people, but  have also distinguished themselves as notable scholars and industrialists for years and are still going strong.” “Kano is historically an emporium of commerce and trade and members of the Isyaku Rabiu family have played a key role in sustaining this positive reputation of the city for years. “I appeal to our younger generation of Nigerians to follow this example of pursuing hard work in order to create wealth and prosperity instead of seeking shortcuts to success by fraudulent means”, he further stated. The President extended his condolences to Abdulsamad Rabiu, the Chairman of Bua Group of Companies and other members of the family as well as to the Government and people of Kano State over the passing of Tijjani Rabiu.
