Adedayo Akinwale ín Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned the post-election violence reported in Kogi State, which led to the death of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) woman leader, Salome Abuh and destruction of property in the state. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement issued yesterday condoled with the family of the deceased and others affected by the post-election violence. He stated: “The APC abhors violence and other criminalities which sadly continue to plague our electioneering process. We urge partisans to see election as a democratic contest and not a do or die affair that we pay with our lives. We pray that the culprits are caught and the full weight of the law is brought to bear on them. “While the Kogi State Police Command says the killing was as a result of a reprisal attack, we urge the Kogi people to ensure this does not escalate. We are aware that the Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has already directed law enforcement agencies to fish out the perpetrators.” The ruling party noted that President Muhammadu Buhari had advised partisans that are not satisfied with the results of governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states to seek redress in court and shun violence.
