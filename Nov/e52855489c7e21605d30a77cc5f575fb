By Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has disclosed that the 2020 budget proposal of the federal government will be passed next week. Lawan, who spoke at plenary on Tuesday, said the budget estimate, which would have been passed this week by the upper chamber, will be passed before the end of next week. He emphasised that the Senate will by next week not tolerate further delay in the submission of the budget report by the Senate Committee on Appropriation headed by Senator Barau Jibrin.
