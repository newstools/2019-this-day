* PDP, Wada Reject Election Results Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has adjourned the collation of the Kogi State governorship election result till 8am Monday. The INEC Returning Officer for the state, Prof. Mohammed Umar, disclosed that this has become necessary to enable the collation officers do their work in the remaining two local government areas — Lokoja and Ibaji respectively. Meanwhile, Governor Yahaya Bello is leading in the results of the 19 local government areas declared by INEC so far. With the results of the remaining two local governments to be collated, the coast is clear for the return of the White Lion to the Lugard House in Lokoja. However, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the election, Musa Wada, have rejected the results of the poll. Wada disclosed this while speaking at a press briefing held at the Suitorial Hotel in Lokoja on Sunday. He described the election as a daylight robbery and a slap on the political will of the entire people of the state that voted on Saturday. “You do not call this an election but a total scam, war and oppression on the innocent people of the state. “It’s just a mere formality to impose their stooge on the people of the state,” he said. He condemned the security settings and described them as a disgrace to the nation democratic system. He vowed to challenge the abnormalities in the court of law. He expressed sadness over the roles the Nigeria Police personnel played during the crisis-ridden election. “If what happened on Saturday is what we all believe to be an election, this democracy is far from what the world thinks of it,” he said.
