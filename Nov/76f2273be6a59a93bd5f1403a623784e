Partners Microsoft in developing enterprise solution in Africa Segun James As part of moves to develop enterprise solutions that would advance the real estate and city management service industry, FilmoRealty is now collaborating and partnering Microsoft on the emerging property technology business in Nigeria. The Managing Director of FilmoRealty, Mr. Luqman Edu, disclosed this at the launching of PropLab.Africa, which highlighted two of the flagship products developed for the real estate industry – VAMP FI and Resido. According to Edu, the VAMP Facilities Intelligence is a smart solution for data-driven facilities and asset management. The platform supports organisations by setting optimal work processes and analysing their facility’s operating costs, service performance and tenant experience. Edu said that with Resido, real estate companies could offer a user-friendly home management app – powered by VAMP FI – to their tenants and ensure that service delivery is seamless, efficient and optimal. He said: “In the lifespan on a building, 60 percent of cost of the property will be at the maintenance stage and how VAMPFi will utilise big data analysis and predictive analytics to reduce operating cost of the property and bring better return on investment.” He said that moving forward, PropLab.Africa would continue to develop solutions and support the growing proptech ecosystem.
