“In the past three weeks, I have embarked on tour of facilities in the six area councils to ascertain the level of infrastructural decay in the rural communities with a view to fixing them in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s mandate to complete all abandoned and ongoing projects,” Aliyu, who was represented at the occasion by the Director of Information and Communications, Mrs Stella Ojeme,said.
She added that through the inspection tours, she had been able to identify areas of needs and prioritised them for proper execution, adding the FCTA will carry out a comprehensive work on its youth centre in Nyanya for skills acquisition of women and youths across the Area Councils. “It is my pleasure to report to you that by December 1, 2019, as part of activities to mark 100 days in office, we will engage 720 women and youths in different skills in each Area Council of the Territory. Also, plans have been concluded to provide 10 boreholes in each Area Council to address challenges of adequate water supply and sanitation”.
