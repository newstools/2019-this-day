Earlier, the lead Counsel to APM, Mr. Sebastine Hon (SAN), said Abiodun submitted a false academic qualification to aid his qualification to contest the 2019 governorship election. Hon contented that there was a difference between what he wrote in the form CFO submitted in 2015 to contest the Senatorial election and the one submitted in 2019 for governorship election. He said that Abiodun was not qualified to contest the governorship election base on his false qualification and urged the court to uphold the appeal.
In his argument, Abiodunâ€™s counsel, Mr. Taiwo Osipitan (SAN), said his client was qualified to contest the governorship election.
Osipitan said the issue of academic qualification was a pre-election matter which ought to have been brought to court within 14 days after the document was submitted. He said that the appellants did not have any grounds of appeal and urged the court to dismiss the appeal.
