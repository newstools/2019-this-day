The CBN has been aggressive in its drive to discourage cash transactions with its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, saying recently that the banking sector regulator would continue to implement the cashless policy in line with its mandate to ensure an efficient payment system. According to Emefiele, contrary to claims in some quarters that many Nigerians would suffer the negative impact of the policy, only about five to 10 per cent of bank customers would be affected. The CBN in a recent circular had announced the re-introduction of three per cent processing fees on withdrawals and two per cent processing fees on lodgments of amounts above N500, 000 for individual accounts. For corporate accounts, banks would charge five per cent processing fees on withdrawals and three per cent processing fee on lodgments of amounts above N3 million. But Emefiele had said if the Nigerian economy was to compete effectively with those of developed countries, there was need to enthrone a payment system that encouraged the use of non-cash channels. He had said before the cashless policy was inaugurated before he assumed office, many stakeholder engagements were done to sensitise Nigerians. According to him, the policy was suspended to allow more payment channels to be developed by banks. “Since the policy was first launched, currency management costs have continued to increase year-on-year at an average annual growth rate of 33 per cent. “Notwithstanding, electronic transactions have increased within the economy. We have provided alternative channels and people have embraced it,” he had said.
