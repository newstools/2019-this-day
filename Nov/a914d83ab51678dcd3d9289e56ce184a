Testifying before the commission, Mrs. Abiola Olabisi, who was the bursar of institution between 2004-2015, said she recorded her financial transactions and expenditures in a notebook and at a point, she fell ill and was bedridden, during which period rainstorm destroyed the roof of her office, which damaged the entire documents inside. The Provost of the College between 2009 – 2016, Dr. Patience. B. Isokpehi, testified that the notebook was destroyed by rainstorm. The Registrar of the institution during the period under review, Mr. John Akhigbe and the current Acting Bursar of the institution, Mr. Ifijeh Ojo, also testified before the commission of inquiry.
