“It is an honour to be here in Nigeria. It’s my first visit to Nigeria and like I said at the lunch meeting, I am very impressed. Everything in this country is huge, is big. It is 20 times the size of the Netherlands and more people live in Lagos than the whole of my country,” Rutte declared. He added that from the discussions we had with the business leaders, it was very clear that despite the fact that there are so many differences, that the two countries have a lot to offer each other politically, economically or culturally. “Politically, Nigeria has taken its responsibility as one of Africa’s most important countries by playing a leading role in the region and by this way expanding democracy in West Africa.I have deep respect for the way Nigeria is doing this including the leadership of the president. “I also want to express my appreciation for Nigeria’s active role in promoting international law in the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Our countries, Nigeria and Netherlands share the belief that international law contributes to a fair and safer world.We are also working together on the issue on migration that is why the minister of migration is part of my delegation and my country is looking forward to continuing this excellent partnership,” he stressed. He noted that one of the focuses of the visit is economic cooperation. He said both Nigeria and the Netherlands stand greatly to benefit from the economic cooperation, adding that there is room for trade expansion as the Netherlands is Nigeria’s third biggest trading partner and major a importer of Nigerian products. On the humanitarian situation in the north east, he said:” We discussed at length the situations both in the Netherlands as well as in Nigeria and also what is happening in the different regions. And we try to be involved as much as possible. As we have this long standing relationship between our two countries, we have a very active embassy here, there is a very active ambassador in the European and the Dutch side and from the Nigeria, we can work together and we can deal with these issues. For example we discussed in 2018 at length one issue, the Lake Chad question and we what we can do together. We hosted a meeting in the Netherlands this year on Lake Chad and what we can do in the immediate future. From the most treacherous issue, what can we do in the immediate future or use some of the Dutch expertise in terms of water, you know you have to call us if it is too much or not enough, if it is too clean or not too clean we can help you.”
