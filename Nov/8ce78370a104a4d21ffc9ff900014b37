Davidson Iriekpen Former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, has appealed to his successor, Bello Matawalle, to pay his outstanding allowance and pension. In a letter dated October 17, 2019 and addressed to the governor, Yari said he is entitled to N10 million monthly as upkeep allowance, but that he has only been paid twice since he left office. In the letter obtained by THISDAY, Yari said the law which provides for the entitlement of former governors, deputies, speakers and deputy speakers was amended in March and that it should not be truncated. “I wish to humbly draw your attention to the provision of the law on the above subject matter which was amended and assented to on March 23, 2019,” he said. “The law provides, among other entitlements of the former governor, a monthly upkeep allowance of N10,000,000 only and a pension equivalent to the salary he was receiving while in office. “Accordingly, you may wish to be informed that since the expiration of my tenure on May 29, 2019. I was only paid the upkeep allowance twice – for the month of June and July while my pension for the month of June has not been paid. “As the law provides, the pension and upkeep allowance are not in the category of privileges that can be truncated without any justifiable reason, hence, the need to request you to kindly direct the settlement of the total backlog of the pension and upkeep as provided by the law. “While thanking you most sincerely for the anticipated positive action, please accept my high regards and esteem.” In the wake of the recent bandit onslaughts in Zamfara, Bello threatened to arrest Yari for allegedly sponsoring the attacks in the state.
