A statement disclosed that at the summit which attracted captains of industry, Mr. Ighodalo said Edo State has been repositioned as an attractive investment destination in Nigeria. “I therefore would like to commend Governor Godwin Obaseki’s foresight and vision in creating this platform. The opportunity created for cross-pollination of ideas between the private sector, public sector and other critical stakeholders has already begun to bear fruit, in moving Edo State forward. “In the area of education, the EdoBest programme has received critical national and international acclaim. A record number of teachers are being taken through a deep dive, technology-enabled training program, and equipped with teaching tablets to facilitate access to 21st century teaching methodologies and resources, to prepare the children of Edo state for the learning of new skills, for a new world. In addition, we have seen schools renovated across the State, and the Government Science and Technology Colleges rejuvenated,” he added. According to Ighodalo, the health sector in Edo State has seen both fiscal and execution commitments (through statutory allocations and the revamp of Primary Healthcare Centres statewide) because only healthy people can constitute a strong and reliable workforce. He added that steps were also being taken for more ambitious projects like the Benin Industrial Park, the Benin River Port and Edo Modular Refinery Project which would further expand economic opportunities in Edo State.
