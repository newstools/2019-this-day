  So far, over N150 billion privatisation proceeds have gone into the funding of the 2019 Budget. Okoh further revealed that from inception to date, the Bureau has successfully completed 234 public transactions through privatisation, commercialisation and concessions with some milestones. According to him, these are expanding private sector participation in the Nigerian economy, attracting quality foreign investors and capital, achieving a more efficient allocation of government resources by redirecting funding of public enterprises by government to other key sectors of the economy that are socially imperative, including healthcare and education.
