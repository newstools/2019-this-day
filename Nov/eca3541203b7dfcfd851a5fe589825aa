It is the big deal because it is the biggest in the world. It is a big deal for me being my first Olympics. I will love to go and experience it. It will be a huge achievement to go to the Olympics, not just going there but going there to make history”. When prodded about her preferred OQT venue, Evelyn said Belgium or France would be her destination of choice while remaining optimistic about the team’s chances of picking one of the 10 tickets on offer from the OQT. “With respect to all the 16 teams, I will possibly love to meet Great Britain, Serbia, maybe Belgium, Spain, Sweden, China and Mozambique in the qualifiers which I believe could brighten our chances of qualification.” She took out time to appreciate Nigerians who have continued to support the National Team. The member of the D’Tigress team to the 2018 FIBA Women World Cup in Spain where they finished 8th in the world stressed that, “There is no women’s  basketball without the fans.

It is a great energy for us to want to push and see that people are watching women’s basketball”, she concluded.
