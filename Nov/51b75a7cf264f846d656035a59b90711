Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba As controversy rages over the new National Minimum Wage, particularly as it relates to the consequential variation across different salary cadres, Delta State Government has constituted a high-powered committee to work with organised labour towards implementing a new minimum wage for the state public service.
