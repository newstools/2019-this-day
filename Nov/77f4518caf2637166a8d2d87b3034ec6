In the first match of the day, UBA and FCMB battled to a one-all draw, with a superior goal difference a point enough was for UBA to clinch the top spot in Group A. First Bank and Fidelity Bank went head-to-head in the second game but tie ended goalless as Fidelity Bank clinched top spot with superior goal difference.
