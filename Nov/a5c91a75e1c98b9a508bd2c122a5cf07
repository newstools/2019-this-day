Chuks Okocha in Abuja and James Sowole in Akure The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) for sending armed thugs to invade the venue of the meeting of its leaders, including Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and the PDP candidate, Engr. Musa Wada, in Lokoja. The party said in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary that several hooded APC thugs, armed with automatic rifles and other dangerous weapons, invaded the venue of the meeting which had Governor Makinde, Wada, his running mate, Hon. Samuel Aro, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, as well as other party chieftains in attendance. According to PDP,  it took the resistance of the security personnel attached to Governor Makinde to save the situation, which would have turned calamitous, as the people of Kogi who were around the venue were already poised for a stiff confrontation. The PDP said that the APC ought to have known by now that their reliance on thugs and violence could not thrive, as the people were ready to defend their state in the election. The party therefore called on the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu to caution the APC as well as put every measure in place to check the activities of APC’s thugs so as to ensure a hitch free, transparent and credible election on Saturday. The PDP also called on the people of Kogi State to remain alert and resolute in their determination to assert their will despite the machinations designed to undermine their spirit at the election. It also states that Nigerians should hold the APC and Governor Yahaya Bello responsible should any harm whatsoever befall any PDP member during the period of the election.
