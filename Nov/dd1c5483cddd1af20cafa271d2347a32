She said 12,000 from six LGAs in the state were expected to benefit from the first phase of the programme, which was aimed at improving the livelihood of poorest of the poor and vulnerable persons.  “This is the fourth category of the SIP that is being implemented in the state. We had N-Power, School Feeding, Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programmes and now we are flagging off the Conditional Cash Transfer programme.  “We are so excited because we have long awaited the disbursement of the conditional cash transfer to start. We had to ensure that the community-based targeting was used to identity poorest of the poor in the different communities”.  She added that the programme would be extended to all the LGAs while beneficiaries would be given the sum of N10,000 once in two months for a two-year period.  “Beneficiaries are being given N10,000 for the months of September and October and they will be given N10,000 in the month of December for November and December disbursement”.  Some of the beneficiaries who spoke at the event commended the federal and state governments for the gesture, promising to spend the money judiciously.  Mrs. Ruth Ovofo, a petty trader, said she would use the money to expand her business and amend her children’s school uniform.  “I am so happy to receive this money. I will invest some of it in my business and also use it to take care of my children. I believe that before the end of the programme, my financial condition would have improved”, she said.
