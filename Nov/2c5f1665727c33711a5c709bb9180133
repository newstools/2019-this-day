Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited had the market the stock market would continue to benefit, especially as fixed income yields remained on the downtrend. “In our view, the still compelling valuations and attractive dividends yields have driven market performance over the past few weeks, a reaction to a limited outlet for investments given recent policy directives limiting domestic participation in the FI market. In the short term, we expect that stock market will continue to benefit, especially as FI yields remain on the downtrend,” they said.
