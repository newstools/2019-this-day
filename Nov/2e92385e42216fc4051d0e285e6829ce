Lumumba is expected to bring his anti-corruption crusade experience to bear on issues stemming from corruption that are holding down growth in Africa. The lecture is in fulfilling part of its objectives of the Foundation, which is the promotion of thought leadership through its bi-annual public lecture series that focuses on engaging the Nigerian public on issues of national and continental relevance.
