Mohammed explained that the virus was first detected in Alkaleri council area in September, adding that efforts had since been on to avoid further spread. He said that government was doing everything possible to ensure that the disease did not spread to the state capital. “That is why government has made efforts through vaccination of people living in the prone areas. “Already, 500,000 doses of vaccines had been administered in Alkaleri and we are expecting 600,000 doses of vaccines to be administered in Ningi community,” he said. According to the BSPHDA chairman, yellow fever is not a communicable disease, adding that it can only be transmitted through mosquitoes.
