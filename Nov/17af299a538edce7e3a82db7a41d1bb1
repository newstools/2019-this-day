 West African Boxing Union (WABU) welterweight champion, Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde, and rising female super featherweight boxer, Cynthia “Bobby Girl” were the standout performers at the maiden edition of GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which held on Saturday at the Rowe Park Sports Complex in Lagos. Baby Face was all menace and speed, knocking out Saheed Lawal in the third of their eight-round national challenge duel.  Lawal, who was a replacement for Dennis “The Range” Mbat, who pulled out on account of an accident, gave a good account of himself in terms of defiance. But the WABU champion’s volume punching at velocity was too much for him, as he was quickly in a daze, forcing the referee to stop the fight. Ogunsemilore, who won her fight by knockout at GOtv Boxing Night 19, confirmed her status as a boxer to watch out for. She defeated Roliat “Mummy’s Pet” Akinsanya by unanimous decision in a thrilling super featherweight bout. The Range boxer exhibited composure and guile beyond her age to outwit her similarly impressive opponent.  In the lightweight category, WABU champion, Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, stopped Ola Adebakin in the first of the scheduled eight rounds. Waheed “Showmax” Shogbanmu got the better of Semiu “Jagaban” Olapade. The cruiserweight duel at the show saw fan favourite, Kabiru “KB Godson” Towolawi defeat Olajide Olatunji via unanimous decision. Among dignitaries at the show were Mr. Sola Aiyepeku, Chairman, Lagos State Sports Commission; Dr. Rafiu Ladipo, President Nigeria Boxing Board of Control (NBB of C); Mr. Remi Aboderin, WABU President and NBB of C scribe; and Ms Jennifer Ukoh, Public Relations Manager, GOtv.
