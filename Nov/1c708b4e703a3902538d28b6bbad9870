Turkish Airlines, the airline that flies to more countries and international destinations than any other airline in the world, recently became the official Airline sponsor of the African Economic Congress, which held at the Musa Yar’ Adua Centre in Abuja. Thus, the flag carrier showed its continual support of the growth of the African continent and its commitment to being a part of it. In June, Turkish Airlines launched flights to Port Harcourt, its third destination in Nigeria, connecting the city to over 300 destinations worldwide. With over 500 participants, the three-day event which was themed “Building the Africa we want: A Scheme into Africa’s Investment Process and Drive”, focused on promoting essential collaborations between Africa and the world while addressing challenges in areas like trade and investment, agriculture, and economic policy. Speaking at the event, General Manager of Turkish Airlines, Abuja, Mr Mehmet Asik said, “Nigeria remains one of our foremost markets, and we continually improve our services to meet the growing demand for travel in order to foster trade relations. At Turkish Airlines, we recognize the importance of tourism and connectivity and that is why we pay extra attention to our excellent service and exciting brand experience. We consider it is important that our passengers have an unparalleled travel experience when they are on-board our aircraft. We understand our positon within Africa’s aviation landscape and our support to the African Economic Congress is a way of demonstrating that.” This is coming on the heels of global carrier’s latest destination in Nigeria, Port Harcourt, where the airline has continued its operation of connecting people to the world.
