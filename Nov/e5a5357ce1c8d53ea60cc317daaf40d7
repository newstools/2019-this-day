In a statement made available to THISDAY, the Managing Director CHI Farms, Dr. Tunji Olaitan, expressed delight about the development, saying the company was pleased with the numbers. He said: “We have invested a lot in our business processes and we are glad that the Government is taking active steps to protect the businesses in Nigeria.” The statement also stated that the border closure restricted the importation of smuggled goods into Nigeria, noting that, “the border closure has since helped many Nigerian businesses.” The Executive Director CHI Farms, Martin Middernacht, in the statement, said CHI Farms was taking steps to invest in preparation for next year. He added that although the company’s sales are at the highest point, but there is still a market demand gap that the company would position itself to fill, “we will significantly invest to meet the emerging demands for our quality chicken in 2020”.
