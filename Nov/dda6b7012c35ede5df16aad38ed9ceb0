According to the President/CEO, World Stage Limited, Mr Segun Adeleye, the fourth industrial revolution was throwing up many questions that stakeholders must answer before setting agenda for the country. “The questions begging for answers include why and how Nigeria missed out in the first three industrial revolutions and how it needs to leapfrog with the 4th industrial revolutions,” he said. “The questions of how the fourth industrial revolution will impact on agriculture where Nigeria has a competitive advantage, and oil, the mainstay of its economy must be answered.” The WorldStage Economic Summit (WES) is conceived to address economic challenges through diagnoses and application of practicable solutions with public and private sector engagement in a research and innovation driven platform to inspire new thinking in business initiative, policy formulation/implementation, economic reform and development.
