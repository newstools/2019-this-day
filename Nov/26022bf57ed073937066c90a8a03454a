Nume Ekeghe Brickstone Africa has reiterated its commitment to help bridge a $108 billion annual infrastructure gap in Africa. The company whose goal is to be Africa’s infrastructure catalyst, has set up the Brickstone Dealcamp Series. As part of this programme, the Project Advisory and Asset Management firm has set up a training themed Project Finance Fundamentals for Infrapreneurs. The training was designed to help, everyone developing large-scale projects, improve their knowledge of project and corporate finance principles in making deals happen. “These infrastructures needs present an investment opportunity, especially for infrapreneurs – entrepreneurs or business owners who are typically in corporate business but now want to develop a new project,” says Femi Awofala, Founder and Lead Partner at Brickstone Africa. “Although, the public sector plays a leading role in major infrastructural developments, there is still a scope for private sector involvement, especially in the housing, power and transport sectors. “Therefore, for infrapreneurs and entrepreneurs who would successfully navigate the project delivery process, there is need to develop their project finance capabilities.” Awofala further noted that research has identified financial constraint and lack of requisite training as two of the main causes of delays and abandonment of project. “This partly explains why Nigeria leads the rest of Africa in the number of abandoned projects, with a survey by the Chartered Institute of Project Management of Nigeria valuing abandoned projects — with regards to the structure(s) already on ground – in the country in excess of N12 trillion.” The training will hold in major African cities, including Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt and Accra.
