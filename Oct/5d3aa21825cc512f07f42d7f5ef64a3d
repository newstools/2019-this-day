 As part of reforms by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to deepen transparency, accountability and inclusive governance, the Edo State Public Procurement Agency (EDPPA) has launched an online project monitoring application, ‘EdoMonitor Me’. The ‘EdoMonitor Me’, a project monitoring and financial planning tool, is a module of the Edo State Project Monitoring System (EDPMS) that gives members of the public easy access to the agency and projects across the state, so as to promote citizen participation in governance and project management. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, EDDPA, Mr. Henry Imogiemhe Idogun, said the ‘EdoMonitor Me’ portal can be accessed on the EDPMS website, adding that “It is fed from the Project Capture and the Geo-Spatial Module of the EDPMS” Idogun noted that the development and deployment of the application is a key reform agenda of the agency, realised through support from the Edo State Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). According to him, “With the deployment of the application which also incorporates the Google Map technology, the Agency has joined the league of states with world-class online project monitoring software which is a landmark achievement and a legacy that would make for efficient functioning of the agency” He added that the software will ensure a more seamless procurement process by creating the avenue for members of the public, including the media and civil societies, to participate in governance. Idogun expressed appreciation to Governor Obaseki for the immense support to the agency, urging members of the public to take advantage of the portal to participate in the governance of Edo State.
