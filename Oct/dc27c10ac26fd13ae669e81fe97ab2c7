Some other processes include providing two guarantors and a riders license. “I know for the riders, you are engaging them in training, you have do’s and don’ts for them and also know them very well. They aren’t like the regular bikers you see on the road and the business is well regulated. “ Earlier, Akpan intimated the police boss of some of the challenges confronting riders in the state, especially harassment from touts and appealed to the law enforcement agency to come to help to address the menace.
