According to the online medium, Aisha was in the United Kingdom for medical treatment.
Her stay in the UK for over two months had generated a range of controversies at home particularly at the height of rumours that her husband, President Muhammadu Buhari had planned to marry 44-year old Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Ms Sadiya Umar Faruk, on Friday. Thus, proponents of the rumour claimed that Buhari was marrying a second wife because Aisha had opted to remain abroad for so long.
