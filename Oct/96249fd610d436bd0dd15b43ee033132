 The Chairman of Air Peace, Chief Onyema Allen, yesterday refuted insinuations that he has a political ambition for his recent intervention in the herdsmen-farmersâ€™ crisis in Benue State.
The philanthropist, who recently airlifted many stranded Nigerians from South Africa, noted that the action was driven by love for peaceful coexistence in the country.
He denied reports that the National Secretary of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Alhaji Alhassan Saleh, apologised for the killings in Benue during a peace meeting he organised.
The Air peace boss had on Saturday facilitated a meeting between the Miyetti Allah and the Benue State Government.
