Liverpool have been fined £200,000 – half of which has been suspended – by the EFL for fielding an ineligible player in their third-round Carabao Cup win against MK Dons. Spaniard Pedro Chirivella, who came on as a substitute in the 2-0 victory, did not have international clearance. The midfielder, 22, needed the paperwork from the Football Association after a loan spell at Spanish side Extremadura last season. Liverpool host Arsenal in the fourth round on 29 October. The EFL said £100,000 of the fine will be suspended until the end of next season.
