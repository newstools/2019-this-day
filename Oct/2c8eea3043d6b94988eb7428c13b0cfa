 Flood has sacked several communities in the Paikoro Local Government Area of Niger State.
Also, many villagers who came to the Kwakuti market on Saturday could also not return home as the flood had taken over the road and the only bridge linking their village to other parts of the local government.
Several hectares of harvested rice, soya beans and corn yet to be Â bagged were also washed away by the flood water.
Many of the villagers were seen at Tuna villager watching helplessly as the torrents washed off their farm produce
