 “The award is a product of the strength of character and the analytical skills and competencies that I took away from the University of Lagos 41 years ago when I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Insurance and came back to touch it up with a Master of Business Administration years later. “In my years in the private sector and even as I now serve in the public service, I have always applied these three core skills ‘In deed and In Truth’ as ingrained in my impressionable undergraduate mind by a university that has become the pride of Africa where global leaders are being churned out. “For me, the award is an invitation and a motivation to offer more profound services to our alma mater, our nation and humanity,” Oyetola added.
