 Seven officials of Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State have been interrogated by the Benin zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegation of corrupt practices as they were alleged to have connived with the council chairman, Augustine Okoibhole, to defraud the council.
As gathered, the Head of Department (HoD) of Works of the council was the first to be invited last Wednesday, but was released by the anti-graft agency when the allegation of corruption could not be traced to him.
The other seven quizzed were said to have been invited after which some of them were granted bail last Friday while a very senior civil servant of the council would also be quizzed later this week.
