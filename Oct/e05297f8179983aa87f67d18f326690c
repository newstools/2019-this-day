The foundation of the Mouka brand was laid in 1959, when the scion of the Faiz Moukarim family started the Moukarim Metalwood factory in Kano to manufacture furniture and iron beds.
Through its 60 years of operating in Africa’s largest economy, Mouka has established over 1,000 branded outlets nationwide, and has remained first choice mattress brand for millions of Nigerians. Since then, the company has also grown to become Nigeria’s leading manufacturer of mattresses and other bedding products.
