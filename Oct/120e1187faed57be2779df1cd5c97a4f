Former World Heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, as expressed concern that Andy Ruiz’s leaner physique will mean a loss of the Mexican’s power in his rematch with Anthony Joshua. The boxing legend had his say on Ruiz’s weight loss, with the heavyweight champion taking diet and conditioning more seriously than before. Tyson told Parimatch: ‘There have been rumours he has lost weight. I don’t like that. I believe losing the weight can affect power sometimes. ‘If it’s not broken, don’t fix it. He did well at that weight, so he should stay at that weight. ‘In the first fight, Ruiz put the pressure on him so fast that he didn’t know what to anticipate. And there were some hard punches.’ Ruiz shocked the world earlier this year when he stopped Joshua to become the first Mexican heavyweight champion. The rematch will take place on December 7 in Saudi Arabia and Ruiz has previously stated: ‘I think being 10lbs lighter, I’m going to be a better fighter.’
