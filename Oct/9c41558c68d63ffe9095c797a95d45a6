CORRIGENDUM  In one of our stories in last week’s edition of HIGHLIFE, we erroneously stated that
Mr. Jimoh Ibrahim’s mother was burnt to death in the fire that gutted her home. We
have since realised she actually died as a result of the lethal fume that enveloped her
home. The mix-up is regretted, as it was not intended to embarrass Mr. Ibrahim, his
friends and family members. We sincerely apologise to him. Editor
