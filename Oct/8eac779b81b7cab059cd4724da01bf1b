He said: “The idea of the conference is to bring together scientists from Germany and Nigeria interested in basic, applied and translational research. “It also seeks to bridge the gap between basic and translational research, with the aim of providing knowledge exchange opportunities, generating future collaborative networks under the concept of translational research to solve problems, thereby fostering an environment of communication and cooperation between basic and clinical scientists, in order to encourage and foster multi-and interdisciplinary collaborations.” He described Humboldt-Kollegs as regional and expert conferences by and for Humboldtians sponsored by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. The foundation, according to him, aims to strengthen regional and professional networking between its alumni and spark junior researchers’ interest in Alexander von Humboldt Foundation programmes and in Germany as a research location.
