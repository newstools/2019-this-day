 Despite Governor Abdullahi Sule’s free education policy for the physically challenged students studying in tertiary institutions owned by Nasarawa State Government, the physically challenged students of the state’s university in Keffi have cried out that they are still paying school fees in the institution.  “Preferably, a census could be carried out by the state government to ascertain the exact number of the unemployed physically challenged graduates for employment by setting up a committee to that effect to avoid job racketeering by government officials.” Earlier, leader of the Disability Advocacy Team and Personal Assistant to the Governor on Disability/Social Media, Awe, said the state governor has mapped out a working plan towards assisting the physically challenged who are either in school or in the informal sector. In his remarks, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Suleiman Mohammed, told the disability advocacy team that the institution has taken it as a policy that a provision must be made for the disabled students. The vice chancellor, who spoke through the Deputy Vice Chancellor Academics, Prof. Peter Osuorji, said: “In order to mitigate the hardship faced by the physically challenged of the institution, henceforth any storey building in the university must have special means of mobility for the disabled.” Mohammed called on the physically challenged students not to hesitate to report anybody maltreating them to management of the institution.
