 Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has alleged that 41,000 out of the 101,000 civil servants in the state are ghost workers and without Bank Verifiable Numbers (BVN).
He made the startling revelation last Friday night at a reception for the visiting members of the FCT Minister’s press corps, who were in Bauchi for their sixth annual retreat.
The state governmnent, according to him, only found out last week about the non-existent civil servants, who were placed on salary by the immediate past administration.
He said the ghost workers didn’t have BVN, which is a clear violation of the federal government’s regulation which makes it mandatory for every worker on the payroll to have BVN.
