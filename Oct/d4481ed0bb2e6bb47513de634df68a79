 Scores of persons narrowly escaped death yesterday afternoon when a two-storey building collapsed at Butcher Lane, Dilimi, Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State.
An eye witness in the community who identified himself as Nura said that the building collapsed at about 3p.m. without any prompting, adding that it was not raining nor was there any vibration that caused the building to go down.
Barely four months ago, a similar incident occurred in the area when a three-storey building hosting a pharmacy shop collapsed killing the owner of the building, his wives and several others.
