Ernest Chinwo in Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has called on Rivers indigenes to invest their resources in the state as a way of developing the state’s economy. Inaugurating Oak Haven Hotels and Suites in Port Harcourt, Wike said Rivers indigenes should form the foundation for investments in the state. He said: “So many people easily criticise, but do nothing for the development of the State. Some make money and invest elsewhere.
“Hon Marcus Nleji has done well. This hotel will create employment and empower the people. It will also generate revenue for the state through taxes.” He said it was not easy to make money and decide to invest it, but that Nleji left the political terrain over eight years ago and could still muster resources to invest. “Those who love their state will take the business risk and invest in the State. Those who don’t love the state will give flimsy excuses and resolve not to invest. “To encourage this new hotel and other businesses on this street, we shall dualise Woji Road. Government will patronise this hotel to ensure it succeeds,” he said. He urged the owner of the hotel to allow the management of the hotel to run it professionally, adding that failure to run the hotel professionally would lead to its collapse. Earlier, Nleji, Chairman of the Oak Haven Hotels and Suites, thanked the Rivers State Governor for improving the investment climate of the state through the development of basic infrastructure. He said prominent Rivers indigenes should prioritise investing in the state before they move to other locations.
He said through the construction of the hotel, he has created employment for 70 persons and that the facilities of the hotel are of international standard.
