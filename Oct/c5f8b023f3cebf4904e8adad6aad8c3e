According to hi, the theme for 2019 edition is: ‘Celebrating sustainable leadership and resilience.’ He explained that awards are in three categories.Firstly is the main competitive awards category (sectoral leadership awards, market excellence awards and overall highest award). Secondly is honorary awards category (Pearl chief executive officer of the year award, outstanding honorary award for capital market development, capital market journalist of the year award and media award for capital market reporting). Thirdly is special recognition awards category (issuing house of the year award, stockbroking firm of the year award and corporate governance award). Orekoya pointed out that the performance of the Nigeria capital market remains unstable. “The instability has continued to have its negative impact on investors’ confidence, especially losses sustained in terms of value depletion by stock holders in the equities market on our stock exchange,” he said.
