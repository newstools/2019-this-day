 Similarlythe Comptroller, NIS, Edo command,  Kayode Eniolorunda, said that the CGI conference was the most important event in the calendar of the service.
Eniolorunda said that this was because far reaching decisions and reform strategies were usually conceived and adopted during the conference.
He said that the state command’s hosting of the 2019 conference was in view of the theme which has to do with migration management and the role of NIS. He noted that irregular migration like human trafficking and smuggling in persons thrive and was very rampant in the state. He, however, said that e-registration would commence in the state before the end of the year as equipment and facilities needed were already on the ground.
