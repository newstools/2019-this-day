 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-led opposition in the House of Representatives has said the N10.3 trillion 2020 budget would be subjected to thorough legislative scrutiny to ensure that it reflects the general aspiration of over 200 million Nigerians.
The Minority Leader of the House, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, in a statement issued yesterday also frowned at reports that certain committees barred the media from covering their budget defence sessions.
