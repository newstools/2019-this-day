Goddy Egene It was another bearish trading last week at the stock market as investors sentiments remained negative. Although the earnings season when listed companies report their results for nine months is already here, many investors are still waiting to see the figures before taking advantage of the low prices of most stocks. As a result, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) fell further by 0.32 per cent to close lower at 26,448.62, while market capitalisation shed N41.5 billion to close at N12.9 trillion.  The persistence bearish trading has led the year-to-date decline of the ASI to hit 15.9 per cent. The market recorded losses in four days. It opened on a positive note the first day, appreciating by 0.10 per cent due to gains in Dangote Cement Plc, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc and United Bank for Africa Plc. But declined by 0.20 per cent, 0.16 per cent and 0.06 per cent on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively. In terms sectoral performance for the week, the NSE Insurance Index led the gainers with 2.4 per cent, followed by the NSE Consumer Goods Index with 0.1 per cent. On the contrary, the NSE Banking Index led the price losers with 2.0 per cent, trailed by NSE Industrial Goods Index with 0.3 per cent. The NSE Oil & Gas Index shed 0.2 per cent. Ahead of the earnings season, analysts at Meristem Securities Limited had advised investors to realign their portfolios to accommodate value and income stocks. According to the analysts, challenging business environment, slow economic growth and Nigeria’s susceptibility to oil price volatility remains the key risks facing the country. And these, they said had led to the weak performances witnessed across the different sectors of the economy. “Economic activities have been largely dampened by delays in the implementation of the government’s capital budget. Likewise, the increased competition and weak infrastructural spending have also hampered growth in the industrial goods sector. Similarly, consumer spending has remained tepid since the exit from recession and this has led to weaker revenues for the fast-moving consumer goods players,” they said. “In the light of all these, our earnings expectation in the third quarter is quite modest, as we do not envisage a reversal from the prevailing market conditions. While the appointment of the ministers and the economic team by the Presidency should provide clarity on fiscal policy, the need to implement structural reforms that will unlock growth and boost investor confidence remains pertinent,” they added. Meanwhile, an analysis of the other African markets showed a mixed performance. The Mauritius market recorded the highest slide of 1.0 per cent. Egypt’s EGX 30 trailed by 0.7 per cent.

In the BRICS markets, performance was relatively bullish as only China’s Shanghai Composite Index declined by 1.2 per cent to close as the only loser.   Analysts attributed the slide to weak economic growth which was the lowest since early 1990s.
