Chiemelie Ezeobi writes that in keeping up with military tradition, the Western Naval Command recently held its regimental dinner, which was an opportunity to enforce regimentation and foster comradeship among senior and junior officers  If there is any institution which adheres to tradition no matter how long ago it was established, it is the military. Tradition they say never dies and that particularly holds true for the military. The Nigerian Navy, one of the tripod arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces, is not an exception. For them, instead of tradition being deemed as archaic and outdated, it is seen as an anchor to their past, constantly reminding them of where they have been, where they are now and where they hope to be. It would therefore be safe to say that the very tapestry or fabric that holds the military together is its customs and traditions. Even though those traditions might not be understood by civilians, because of what they deem excessive regimentation, for the military, those same traditions are their heritage, even as they seek to align themselves with contemporary modern day structures and practices.
