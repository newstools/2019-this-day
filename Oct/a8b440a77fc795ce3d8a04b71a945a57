 Former Lagos State Governor and national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has dismissed report claiming that he’s opposed to the ongoing construction of cargo airport in Ekiti State.
A section of the media, which recently reported that the APC national leader had expressed opposition to the project, quoted Tinubu as saying: “There is no need for an airport in Ado-Ekiti, the capital of Ekiti State.”
