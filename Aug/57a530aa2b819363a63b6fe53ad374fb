 The Edo State Broadcasting Service (EBS) has remitted a total of N20 million to the Edo State Government being revenue generated internally from December 18, 2018 to July 31, 2019.  The improved financial health of the station follows radical reforms instituted by the state government to reposition the media house for optimum service delivery.  Specifically, besides the improved Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), the new management has vigorously pursued cost-effective measures by paying attention to serviceable equipment and blocking revenue leakages in the system.  In its July Report, Acting General Manager of the service, Mr Ransley Abu-Osagie, said that the outfit remitted a total of N20 million since he assumed management of the station, noting, “In revenue generation, EBS paid a total of N2,400,000 to IGR in July, 2019, thus making the total amount remitted to government N20 million since December 18, 2018 to July 13, 2019, that is, seven months and twelve days.”  He added that “the station engaged government-approved external auditors, Lucky Osawaru and co-firm to commence work on the station’s 2017 and 2018 accounts.”  He said the station deployed novel means to address issues with its transmission equipment and partnered with the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (EBS) in addressing some of its power supply challenges.  According to him, “Repair work on GoTV (system) which was achieved in June was damaged by inclement weather. Steps are already being taken to re-launch on GoTV.”  Recall that Governor Obaseki embarked on an overhaul of EBS in its commitment to revamp the state-owned media enterprises.  The overhaul led to the appointment of new management that has turned the loss-making entity into a revenue-generating outfit.  The state government is completing processes for procurement of new equipment to improve the broadcasting service.
