The bishop also asked God to give the governor the Holy Spirit and uphold his vision for the people, saying: “Since he is striving for the good of the people of Enugu State and beyond, satisfy his heart’s desires; everywhere he ventures into, let him prosper”. While expressing confidence that the governor will fully actualise his sound vision for the state, at the end of his tenure, the bishop equally asked God to “give him a strong faith, hope and good heart that will help him accomplish his task”. Okoye, who appreciated God for His mercy and kindness on his mother, added that “it is by your (God’s) direction that we all have gathered here to give you praise for what you are doing for our mother”.
