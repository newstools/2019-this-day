Reacting to the award, Aity Dennis said, “I was invited to the concert /award event and believe me, I didn’t know I was one of the persons to be honoured. “The organisers kept it as a secret! As one of the guest artistes, I sang and after the concert, the award proper commenced. I was busy applauding the other people as they received their awards. “Then suddenly I heard them reading a profile that sounded like mine, I looked around to be sure I wasn’t mistaken, then I heard: ‘all the way from Nigeria let’s make welcome … And there was my name! God has been busy surprising my life with goodies but I think this is one of greatest surprises I’ve gotten in recent times. “ Other awardees at the event included Bishop Simeon Agbolabari, Ken Rawlings, Bola Kwentua, Sam Kolawole, Chinye Keshi, Chinonye Azuonye, Joshua Amzat, Kingsley Ike.
