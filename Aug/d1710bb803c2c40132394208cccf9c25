Berates presidency for politicising security issues Chuks Okocha in Abuja The alleged secret burial of over 1,000 soldiers in the ongoing anti-insurgency in  Maiduguri  has continued to generate ripples as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday called  on the National Assembly to immediately open an inquest into the shocking report by the Wall Street Journal. The party in a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said that they were demanding that the National Assembly should respond to the apprehensions of Nigerians by immediately setting up a special security committee to conduct a forensic investigation into the truth or otherwise of the report, with the tenor and mode as prescribed for security issues in the 1999 Constitution (as Amended.) According to the statement, “PDP’s demand is predicated on the brazen attempt by the Buhari Presidency to politicise such huge security issue and making uncomplimentary allusions to the plight of our troops, in yet another unpatriotic and insensitive press release on the state of our nation. “It is unfortunate that at this time when patriotic Nigerians are distressed about the well-being of our gallant soldiers and seeking for solutions to the challenges they face in the front, the Buhari Presidency is rather issuing press statements, just like the one it released on Friday, August 2, 2019, wherein it leveraged on the plight of our soldiers to boast on how to retain a stolen presidential mandate. “Instead of showing concern over the fate of our troops, taking concrete steps on the issue at stake and reassuring an anxious nation, the Buhari Presidency is rather seeking to draw political capital from our security challenges by flaunting a despicable self-confidence on the Presidential election petition pending in the Court of Appeal, and how, in its own words, ‘the judiciary would always come to conclusions’. “It is imperative to state that such comments send very wrong signal against our judiciary and we urge the judiciary arm to insulate herself from the nocturnal shenenanigans of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the cabal at the Presidency, which have gone into frenzy following the apparent collapse of their defence at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal,” PDP said. The party further said that while the Buhari Presidency, had with its latest stance on such grave security issue, further exhibited that it had come short of appropriate solutions to the security challenges facing our nation, the PDP stated that waving off of such without the least effort to unravel the issues and reassure Nigerians, showed total failure of leadership. According to the statement, “The PDP holds that President Buhari has again failed to demonstrate that he has the capacity and commitment to ensure the security of our nation. “Our party thus stands solidly behind the people’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in his patriotic concerns over the report. Only a leader, who lacks genuine concern for his people, will gloat over such a report, as being witnessed under the Buhari administration”.
