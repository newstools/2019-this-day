Alexis Sanchez has landed in Milan ahead of completing his loan move to Inter from Manchester United. It marks a fresh start for Sanchez and brings to an end a torrid 18 months at United. Representatives from both clubs have been working on a deal for over a month and finally a breakthrough arrived earlier this week. Sportsmail reported earlier, however, that Sanchez will still be United’s second-highest earner despite being on loan to Inter. It is understood that the 30-year-old pockets an eye-watering £400,000 a week, before bonuses, at United after signing from Arsenal last January. Inter have agreed to pay close to £4.5million of the Chile international’s £21m annual salary, meaning United will have to subsidise a significant portion of his wages. The move means Sanchez will link back up with close friend Romelu Lukaku at the San Siro. Lukaku and Sanchez struck up a close friendship during their time together at Old Trafford and the Belgian reportedly begged the Chile star to follow him to Italy. That £21m is Sanchez’s basic wage. Bonuses if met could earn him as much as £560,000 per week. It is understood that United will still pay around £300,000 towards Sanchez’s weekly earnings despite the striker spending the season on loan at Inter.
