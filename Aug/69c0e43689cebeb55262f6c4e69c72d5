The National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has commiserated with the General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Worldwide, Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya, over the death of his mother, Mama Janet Olukoya, at 95. In a condolence letter written Thursday to Pastor Olukoya, Tinubu urged the General Overseer and the children his mother left behind to take solace in the fact that she lived a life of service to God and humanity, and also died at a ripe old age. The APC leader said in the letter he personally signed: “Please accept my deepest sympathy and condolences over the death of your mother, Mama Janet, at 95. “The loss of any of our parents is always a painful thing. I know how it feels because I have experienced that before. But we must always take solace in the lives our parents lived and recall memories of the times we shared together. “I understand Mama was a devout Christian who lived a life of service to God and humanity. We must thank God that she lived to a ripe old age and left behind good children. “My condolences also go to other family members and all worshippers at the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries over the demise. “My prayer is that God Almighty accept her soul and grant her everlasting rest. May He also grant you and all the children Mama left behind the strength to carry on with her good deeds”.
