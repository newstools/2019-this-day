Tottenham have ended their interest in Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho. Spurs had been considering a loan move for the 27-year-old Brazilian, who joined Barca from Liverpool in a deal worth Â£142m in January 2018. Coutinho worked with Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino during a loan spell with Espanyol in 2012. He has scored 21 goals in 76 appearances for Barcelona but has been repeatedly linked with a move away from the Nou Camp this summer. Arsenal, Paris St-Germain and former employers Liverpool were among the clubs linked with a move for the playmaker.
