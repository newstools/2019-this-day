The new man said to be in the picture is Lekan Gbadamosi, a Nigerian entrepreneur who shuttles between Nigeria and the United Kingdom on business. Those in the know claimed that Caroline is so besotted with the dude that she is always all over him whenever he is around.

He is said to have talked multiple romances with several popular ladies in the past but nothing came out of them. Some are saying he might not be all that, but Caroline doesn’t seem to care. She is determined to enjoy her new romance to the fullest without caring whose ox is gored.
