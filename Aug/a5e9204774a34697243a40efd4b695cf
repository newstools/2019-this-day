However, an invitation was extended to Mrs. Dakolo for an interview with the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) Mike Ogbizi. The Force spokesman, Frank Mba, who confirmed the story, said: “He was released in the early hours of this morning (Wednesday) but he is back to the Force CID. The witnesses we were expecting from Port Harcourt and others were also interviewed on Tuesday before his release. At the end of the day, we granted him bail but he is back to Force CID now. “So, Fatoyinbo is back and we are still continuing our work and he is most likely going to still be grilled today.” On whether Busola was also invited for interrogation, he said: “She is at liberty to come to the FCID because it is a case involving her.”
