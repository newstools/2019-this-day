South Africa, Nigeria driving African economically, socially for the next fifty or so years and in that frame work we need to address the issue of security of Nigerians in South Africa at the very highest level. When the two presidents are engaged on this, I think all those below that have to do something will be forced to do something.” Onyeama noted that while there was a trust deficit between the Nigerian Union in South Africa and the South African police, he said it was important to get the two working together to address this issue The minister explained further that Citizen diplomacy would be a major priority in the next four years, while the ministry would equally continue to engage various countries to ensure repatriation of stolen funds.

As a help desk for every Nigerian anywhere in the world, if they have complaints that are going to be addressed at the highest possible level. Onyeama stated that the ministry would provide oversight over all Nigerian agencies around the world to ensure that they are providing the best services they can for Nigerians. “In that context too, we have to look in particular the security of Nigerians in all the countries around the world.
