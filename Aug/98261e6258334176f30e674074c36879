My goal as an artiste is to make good music for people to enjoy, I also want people to listen to my songs and be inspired. I want music that people will learn from. Music is my life and I want to feed people’s soul with good sound, good vibe, sweet rhythms and colourful lyrics. Where do you see yourself in a few years? To be sincere, in a few years, I see myself being one of the most successful artistes in Nigeria. My dream is to become one of Nigeria’s biggest artistes.
