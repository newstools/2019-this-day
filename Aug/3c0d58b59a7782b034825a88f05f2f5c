The DPO was freed after allegedly paying the sum of the M3 million to the kidnappers. The DPO who was simply identified as Okoro, was abducted by the kidnappers and taken away to an undisclosed location. He was however, freed on Sunday after his relatives were said to have paid the agreed ransom at a designated location. Sources at the state police command headquarters in Asaba, who spoke off the record, told THISDAY that the victim was freed by his abductors after paying a ransom of N3 million. The Commissioner of Police Delta State, Mr. Adeyinka Adeleke, however, denied the incident and the subsequent payment of ransom. He said it was the DPO’s friend, who was kidnapped. He added that he had been in touch with the DPO and that the police do not support the payment of ransom for kidnap victims.
