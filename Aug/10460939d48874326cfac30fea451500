Finally, the ‘Pull Over’ crooner has reunited with his friend Ocheku Osheme. Kcee had sometime in July taken to social media to enlist the help of his teeming followers to locate a long lost friend. According to the artiste, his last interaction with Osheme happened over 20 years ago. They grew up together in Ajegunle, and Osheme was his best friend, the boy he could absolutely count on to be there for him. But since they lost touch, his hopes of running into Osheme had remained. He posted an emotional video on Twitter and Instagram on Tuesday, July 23, pleading with his followers to share and like the video until Osheme was located. Having built its entire brand persona around the spirit of mateship, it was only logical that “33” Export would commit itself to help Kcee, or anyone at all, on his mission to reestablish great friendship. “I’ve been thinking of Osheme a lot of late and I knew I had to find him. For “33” Export to not only lend their support but also join me on the search? That’s priceless and I’ll forever be grateful,” said Kcee. “33” Export took its contribution a step further by rewarding two of Kcee’s fans by helping them reconnect with their own long lost buddies. Speaking on why the brand chose to join the search, Brand Manager, “33” Export, Aminah Jagun said, “With all of the unique activities “33” Export has championed around friendship in the past, we couldn’t pass off an opportunity like this to show our support and also solidify our stance as a brand that cares. ‘33’ Export has firmly establishing its place in the minds of its loyal consumers as the No 1 friendship beer brand that cares about the relationship it shares with them and their friends.”
