The Edo State Government has said construction work at The John Odigie-Oyegun Institute of Public Administration on Okada Avenue, GRA, Benin City, which is nearing completion, will consolidate ongoing civil service reforms by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration.  Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the state government is fully committed to the reforms tailored towards building a world-class workforce to drive seamless service delivery.  He said construction of the John Odigie-Oyegun Training Institute, a three-storey building, is 95 per cent complete, and is fitted with large training rooms and is to be fitted with latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) equipment.  “Construction work at the Institute is at the completion stage with tilling work almost complete. We are working on the painting and electricals in the buildings,” he said.  Osagie added that the Centre is designed with the capacity to host about 1000 people at a time and will host training programmes by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), amongst others.  The governor’s aide said other features of the Institute include two halls capable of holding 118 people each and seven training halls that will host 58 people each,  a library, a sick bay, a cafeteria and 12 offices.  Osagie explained that the Governor Obaseki-led administration is committed to other welfare packages to achieve a highly skilled and motivated workforce.  “The governor has remained committed to prompt payment of workers’ salaries. Every employee of the state government gets their monthly pay on or before 26th of every month.  “Pensioners who have served the state meritoriously are also getting pension regularly. Those, who were owed areas in the past are being attended to and their arrears cleared monthly after due documentation,” he added.
