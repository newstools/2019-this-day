Medical doctors in specialist hospitals in Maiduguri, Borno State have suspended their planned strike following an agreement reached with the state government. They had planned to embark on an indefinite strike on August 5, to protest the non-payment of eight month salaries and allowances. A communiqué signed by Dr Mathew Aristotle, the Liaison Officer of the house officers of the hospital on Monday, announced the suspension of the planned action. The doctors said the development followed interventions by concerned citizens and organisations, leading to a series of mediation between the doctors and the management of the hospital. It stated that the doctors were not paid salaries for between three and eight months in spite of directives by Governor Babagana Zulum to upset their outstanding salaries and allowances. “The medical doctors involved are denied their salary arrears ranging from three to eight months in spite the directives by Governor Zulum to resolve the matter about three months ago. “The board and hospital’s administration be given five working days between August 5 and August 9 to intervene by meeting those responsible and bring an end to this lingering impasse. “The Medical Doctors House Officers hereby rescind its earlier decision to embark on industrial action on Monday,’’ it said. The communique lauded Zulum for his concern for the doctors’ plight and commitments to reposition healthcare service delivery in the state. It also commended individuals and organisations, who facilitate mediation between the doctors and hospital management to ensure amicable solution to the problem. (NAN)
