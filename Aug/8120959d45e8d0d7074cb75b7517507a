Airtel Nigeria has taken step to deepen broadband connectivity in homes and offices across the country as it announced the rollout of its broadband value offering. The telco said the launch of its Home Broadband offerings rides on its expansive and modernised 4G network, which has been deployed in over 130 cities and towns across Nigeria, making it the first operator to launch the product in all 36 states including the Federal Capital Territory. The Airtel Home Broadband (HBB) package is available in Routers and MiFis and comes in various affordable recharge plans, offering up to 100GB of databonus. Under the new Airtel Home Broadband plans, when a customer purchases an Airtel Router for N25,000, he or she is instantly credited with 100GB data and also offered complimentary 10GB data for 6 months on purchase of the Airtel N10,000 data bundle plan.
The Airtel MIFI comes at N15,000 and offers instant 40GB data and an additional 5GB monthly for 6 months on purchase of the N5,000 Data Bundle plan.
