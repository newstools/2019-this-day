NAN recalls that the police authorities had on Wednesday announced the killing of its personnel from the Force Headquarters on covert operation by the troops along Ibi-Wukari road in Taraba state. The police had alleged that the suspected kidnappers in custody of the attacked officers were released by the troops. Army Headquarters, in reaction, described the incident as `unfortunate and avoidableâ€™ while explaining its own side of the story. The army had explained that the said soldiers, while responding to a distress call to rescue a kidnapped victim, exchanged fire with the suspected kidnappers along Ibi-Wukari Road in the State. The police, in a counter reaction on Thursday, had raised a number of questions that the army authorities needed to unravel especially the whereabouts of the arrested suspected kidnapping kingpin, Alhaji Hamisu Bala Wadume.
