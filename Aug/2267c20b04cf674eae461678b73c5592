Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City The Edo State Government has met with officials of the World Bank and the European Union (EU) to review the impact of the multi-pronged strategy being deployed in the fight against human trafficking in the state. Speaking on the meeting, the state Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, said the meeting provided stakeholders the opportunity to appraise the work done so far and set new targets as the fight against human trafficking is something that must be sustained. According to him, “We will continue to seek creative ways to sustain the fight against human trafficking and deepen our relationship with our partners; the World Bank, the European Union and other stakeholders.” The meeting which held in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, had in attendance World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Rachid Benmessaoud, Head of the EU Delegation to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Ambassador Ketil Karlsen, among others. Part of the Edo State delegation includes Commissioner for Justice and Attorney General of the state, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe and Chief of Staff to the Governor, Chief Taiwo Akerele, among others. The European Union and the World Bank are critical stakeholders in the campaign against human trafficking and illegal migration championed by the Edo State Government. Both organisations have made critical commitments to the campaign and have provided support to ensure that the state government builds essential support structures and institutions to discourage illegal migration. Some of the projects captured under the partnership include the rehabilitation of the Government Science and Technical College, which is expected to serve as a centre of excellence in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) for youths in the state.
