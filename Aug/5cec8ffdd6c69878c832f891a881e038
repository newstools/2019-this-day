Goddy Egene The downtrend at the stock market continued last week, leading to a sixth consecutive negative close. The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NSE ASI) fell by 1.17 per cent to 27,630.46, as investors ignored the earning season and continued taking profit. The   market capitalisation shed N157.7 billion to close at 13.3 trillion.  Year-to-date, the market has declined by 13.1 per cent. Although the market performance is seen as a negative development, it has depressed prices of stocks to a comfortable entry level. The market had opened on Monday on a positive note as gains in Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc lifted the NSE ASI by 0.10 per cent. However, the market turned negative on Tuesday, as it shed 0.5 per cent. The bearish trend was sustained on Wednesday with a decline of 0.4 per cent.  There was a little respite on Thursday as the market inched up marginally by 0.05 per cent. But the bears returned on Friday, dragging the index by 0.40 per cent, leading to a fall of 1.17 per cent for the week. In terms of sectoral performance, the NSE Banking Index led the losers with  6.1 per cent  on the back of sell pressures in Unity Bank Plc (-13.5 per cent ), FBN Holdings Plc(-11.6 per cent) and Zenith Bank Plc (-10.7 per cent). Banking stocks remained under pressure despite the improved results already released by some of the banks. Unity Bank Plc, which shed 13.5 per cent last week, had reported a 96 per cent jump in profit for the half year to June 30, 2019. Also, FBN Holdings Plc that went down 11.6 per cent, ended the H1 2019 with improved profitability and decline in non-performance loans(NPL). The Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings Plc, Mr. UK Eke recently said the company was committed to delivery sustainable long-term performance following continuous improvement in the NPL. FBN Holdings NPL ratio has dropped to 14.5 per cent  from 25.3 per cent  as of March 2019 and 25.9 per cent  at the end of 2018 financial year. “Despite the difficult operating environment, we remain resolute in delivering on our guidance across key metrics including our commitment towards a single digit NPL ratio by the end of year, as evidenced by the reduction in NPLs from the last quarter. Essentially, Atlantic Energy – our largest NPL, was written off, translating to a decline in the NPL ratio from 25.9 per cent in December 2018 to 14.5 per cent as at June 2019, a step that brings us closer to our FY 2019 target and creates more headroom for quality asset growth. “This is paving the way for sustained improvement in asset quality and a further reduction in impairment charges that will allow us to take advantage of enhanced earnings opportunities when they arise. “Furthermore, we have remained focused on deepening our transaction-led income and are uniquely positioning for stronger revenue growth and value creation,” Eke said. Also speaking, the Chief Executive Officer, First Bank and Subsidiaries, Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, said: “In line with our commitment to address the legacy asset quality challenges, exposure to Atlantic Energy was written off in the quarter. “This is a material progress in our legacy NPL resolutions and clearly reflects our resolve towards achieving a single digit NPL ratio by year end. In addition, this step creates significant headroom for increased business opportunities and enhanced earnings especially in the oil & gas sector of the economy.” The NSE Insurance Index shed 3.9 per cent, while the NSE Oil & Gas Index and NSE Consumer Goods Index went down by 1.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent in that order.
