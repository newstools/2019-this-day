Commenting on the development, the Executive Director, Retail Banking, Mr. Victor Etuokwu, said: “Our business is all about our customers as our success can be directly attributed to their success. “We have helped millions of people save with DiamondXtra and have rewarded thousands over the last 10 years, with this year being the eleventh edition. “To encourage more people to save, we have digitised the scheme to accommodate customers who are not able, for one reason or another, to go the branch to open a DiamondXtra account. “New customers can simply dial *901#, follow the prompts to open a DiamondXtra account and fund with a minimum of ₦5,000 to be one of our lucky winners.” “To join our winning train, all you need to do is to save up, if you are already a DiamondXtra customer, or open a DiamondXtra account with just N5,000 and save multiples of N5,000 to increase your chances of winning, he concluded.
