Welcoming, the governor, the Chief Executive Officer of NSE, Mr. Oscar Onyema, said the exchange was ready to partner the state to have access to capital to build a sustainable economy for the state. “Your strategies towards revitalising the agricultural, manufacturing, mining, trade and tourism sectors, which together account for 75 per cent of the state’s gross domestic product (GDP) are also commendable. “For instance, you have increased the proportion of capital spending in the 2019 budget to 44 per cent from 31 per cent in 2018; and channelled budgetary resources towards pro-growth projects in these sectors such as the: development of a land bank for the state; establishment of one-stop investment promotion centre and enterprise zone industrial clusters; widespread road constructions, electrification and ICT infrastructure; as well as rehabilitation of Fountain Hotels and commencement of an Ekiti State Airport project,” Onyema said. He noted that at the NSE, “we recognise that to build a sustainable economy for the estimated 3.5 million citizens of Ekiti State, supported by vibrant sectors, both state-owned and private sector enterprises will require access to right-sized capital.” “We have been longstanding partners with Ekiti State in accessing such capital. Your Excellency would recall that during your previous term in office between 2010 and 2014, The exchange supported the issuance and listing of the N20 billion Fixed Rate Infrastructure Development Bond, which financed a number of projects including the Ikogosi warm spring redevelopment, the Ekiti Water Works construction, as well as the refinancing of high-interest borrowings by the state. “In that time frame, the Ekiti economy expanded by over 63 per cent in nominal terms to become a trillion naira economy, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The state also recorded a 15 per cent improvement in terms of the enabling business environment assessments by the World Bank. “Today, the exchange is even more strategically positioned, having transformed into a multi-asset class exchange hub, to further support the developmental goals of Ekiti State in unlocking significant investment value through the listing of public utilities and state-owned enterprises, issuance of subnational bonds, as well as promoting the knowledge economy within the state in terms of public sector capacity building through our technology based learning management system,” the NSE CEO said. Onyema explained that as the exchange builds awareness and attracts local and international investors, they would partner with the State and its agencies to achieve the benefits of privatisation of its state owned enterprises and other initiatives of both entities across various sectors. “It is my hope that this interactive session of Facts Behind the State Economy will create the strategic in-roads for: innovative capital market solutions to the developmental needs of the state and benefit of the good people of Ekiti State; as well as collaboration and support between Ekiti State, the Nigerian Stock Exchange and the capital market community,” he added.
