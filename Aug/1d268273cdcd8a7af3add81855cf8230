Ahmed said each of the affected 35 states received N17.5billion as bailout from the Federal Government. She said that already the Council had agreed to constitute a team to finalise modalities for commencement of repayment of the loan facility. The team according to her would be constituted from the Nigerian Governors Forum to meet with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Ministry of Finance. “The Minister of Finance briefed NEC on the progress of the facilitaties detailing how the Federal Government has made a total of over N614 billion available to 35 States being N17.5 billion each. “Council agreed to constitute a team from the Nigerian Governors Forum to meet with the CBN and Ministry of Finance to finalise modalities for commencement of payment,’’ she said.
