I want to inform you that I will not condone this anymore”. He stressed the need for medical doctors, nurses and other medical personnel to create a relationship of trust with patients in healthcare institutions across the state for effective service delivery. While calling for attitudinal change, the governor affirmed that the kind of reception given to a patient by both doctors, pharmacists and nurses would make them to have relief.
