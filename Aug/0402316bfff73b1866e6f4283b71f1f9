According to the Managing Director of BetBonanza, Kunle Adeniji: “We are coming to the market with a new identity and mission that offers customers better bet to change their fortunes for good. “We are ready to compete for our share of the betting business against the best. We have a very strong team that understands customers needs and ready to offer them the best odds. We are coming from a very rich background with foreign partners that make our offers and products very unique and outstanding. Adeniyi affirmed that “We are offering our stackers the best odds and career opportunities for our agents and youths. Rather than waste their talents, we want our customers to commercialize their excellence. We want them to be exceptional, hence our pay off is ‘Be Better.’ BetBonanza is the sure way to go as we provide high quality betting opportunities.” The event which will take place in Lagos would be heralded by the unveiling of a brand ambassador and the presentation of the company’s brand logo and mission statement. The online version of the business was launched on the 24th of July, while the retail market began operations two months ago.
