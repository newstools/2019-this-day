 “The adoption and successful execution of the rotation at both state and local government levels in a seamless manner have put the state on auto drive on the path to sustainable development “, Ogeah stated. He said Delta State  had built the spirit of camaraderie, oneness and common purpose among its diverse people through the craftsmanship of the political leadership, making every component unit to share in a common sense of belonging. The former commissioner commended Okowa for successfully steering the state through the challenging economy by astute management of limited resources, especially during prolonged economic recession while still meeting his campaign pledges to the people. He noted that Asaba, the state capital, is steadily living up to its status in the past four years and commended the governor for initiating measures to resolve the protracted flooding in the city through network of storm drainage nearing completion.  He said the people of Delta State had every reason to celebrate as it remains on the right track to development.
