Making the announcement, the Managing Director, Nosak Distilleries Limited, Osaro Omogiade expressed excitement after receiving the certificate of registration of the product from the Food and Drugs Authority of Ghana. “This is yet another milestone in our operations in the sector and we are particularly delighted as we commence export operations to other West African countries beginning with Ghana, our sister country”, he said. Omogiade explained that, “Nosak Distilleries Limited is the leading ethanol manufacturer in Nigeria producing 500,000 litres per day and over 180 million litres per annum. We own and operate three modern distilleries for manufacturing various industrial and consumer chemicals, particularly ethanol. The capacity of our plant contributes over 50 percent of the local demand for ethanol and other industrial chemicals.”
