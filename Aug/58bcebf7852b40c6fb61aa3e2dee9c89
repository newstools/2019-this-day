The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore Social-cultural Association yesterday filed an appeal against the July 4 ruling of the Federal High Court in Abuja. The Fulani socio-cultural group, in a suit number: FHC/ABJ/CS/527/2017 filed by its counsel, Mr. Aliyu Ahmed and Abdulhamid Mohammed, said it was dissatisfied with the judgment of Justice Abang delivered on July 4 in suit number: FHC/ABJ/CS/527/17. The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore Social-cultural Association had challenged the 2017 Open Grazing Prohibition and Establishment Law passed by the Benue State House of Assembly. The group had approached the court seeking a mandatory injunction against the state government from implementing the laws as passed by the stateâ€™s House of Assembly.
