Commenting on the performance of the market, analysts at Afrinvest (West Africa) said: “We expect the bearish momentum to continue although there is room for gains due to opportunities for bargain hunting in fundamentally sound stocks.” Generally, the African markets were bearish apart from Egypt that gained 0.7 per cent.

Looking at the developed markets under its coverage, Afrinvest said there was a sustained bullish performance despite trade tensions. According to Afrinvest, United States (US) and China resumed trade negotiations, but tensions worsened last week as both countries implemented new tariff measures and announced new ones. “On September 1, 2019, the US applied 15.0 per cent tariff on $125 billion worth of Chinese imports as planned, with a further $156 billion expected to be affected by December 15. In addition, the US plans to increase the existing tariff on a separate $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30.0 per cent from 25 per cent by October 1, 2019. “China imposed tariff between 5.0 per cent and 10 per cent on $75 billion worth of US goods as countermeasures, with more expected in response to the actions of the US. In the United Kingdom, the risk of a ‘no-deal-Brexit’ eased as a bill to forestall it, which is likely to pass, was brought forward by lawmakers,” it said. However, the  US S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices gained to 1.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively on optimism about the restart of trade negotiations. In Europe, France’s CAC, Germany’s XETRA DAX and UK’s FTSE All Share indices were up 2.2 per cent, 1.9 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively as the chance of a ‘no-deal-Brexit’ weakened. Similarly, Japan’s Nikkei 225 appreciated 2.4 per cent W-o-W while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 3.8 per cent as sentiments strengthened following the withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index led with 3.9 per cent gain, reversing the previous week’s loss despite additional tariffs while Russia’s RTS Index went up by up 3.6 per cent. Brazil’s Ibovespa and South Africa’s FTSE/JSE indices also inched up 1.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent in that order in spite of slowdown in economic activities due to unrest in the latter country.
