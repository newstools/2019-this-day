Ever since I became an Orphan and we all had to find our way around things, I had always been involved in one job or the other as at the age of 17. When I gained admission into the University of Ibadan, I had learnt how to make hair and tie Gele so I got paid for hair and because I knew how to tie Gele , it was expected that I render makeup services too so I learnt via YouTube.’ Her company, MLPro isn’t just a makeup brand but a motivational and inspirational brand set to be a blessing to others not just through makeup but other things related.
