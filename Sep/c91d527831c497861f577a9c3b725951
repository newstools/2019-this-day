‘Eyes of a Lagos Boy’ photographer Bolaji Alonge, will present an outdoor photo
exhibition on Femi Kuti, the scion of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, at Freedom Park Lagos during Felabration 2019. Felabration is an annual music festival conceived in memory and celebration of Fela Kuti, a Nigerian music
legend and human rights activist known
for pioneering afrobeat. Femi Kuti is Fela Anikulapo-Kuti’s eldest son and the strongest proponent of his legacy. Felabration is held during the week of Fela’s birthday. The week-long event is held held at the New Afrika Shrine in Ikeja and at Freedom Park, Lagos Island. It attracts visitors from all over the world and has thus been considered as an official tourist destination by the Lagos State Government.
