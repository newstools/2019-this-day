Salisu Yusuf Majigiri, in a telephone interview, told THISDAY that there was no official document informing the party of the relocation of the tribunal to Abuja. He said PDP and its 2019 governorship candidate, Senator Yakubu Lado, would honour the ‘oral’ invitation to attend the sitting in Abuja before they would make their final stand on the decision taken by the three-man panel. According to him, “We have just been told of the change in the venue of the tribunal. It is now shifted to a magistrate court at Wuse, Abuja. We are on our way there now for the adoption of the addresses slated for tomorrow (Tuesday) before we can make our stand known to the public.” Meanwhile, before the announcement of the new venue, counsel to the parties in the governorship petition were supposed to adopt their various written addresses today (Monday) before the tribunal would give a date for the ruling on the petition. Senator Lado and his party, the PDP, had dragged Governor Aminu Bello Masari and his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), before the tribunal, challenging the result of the March 9, 2019, governorship election. Masari, APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are the first, second and the third respondents in the petition.
