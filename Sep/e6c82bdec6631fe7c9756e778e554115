Ugo Aliogo Infinix Nigeria has hosted afro-pop superstar Davido in its Lagos office. According to a statement by the company, the visit was centered on discussions on how the partnership can further empower more Nigerians, adding that Davido being an influential personality in the musical industry and Infinix mobility being a trend-setting smartphone brand, there is a need to maintain an undisputable profile for empowering its youthful and tech-savvy target audience. The statement said the partnership has since inception served to inspire and empower young adults within their scope of influence, both locally and globally. The statement further added that a typical example of an initiative from both entities geared towards empowering youths and supporting creativity amongst young adults is the recently concluded #Infinixblowmymindchallenge that saw winners go home with a total cash prize of 500,000 Naira and other amazing branded gifts. According to the statement: “Infinix mobility unveiled Davido as its brand ambassador last year on the 8th of May 2018. It was a remarkable feat for both parties as Davido put pen to paper to sign the contract. Both brands- customers of Infinix mobility and fans of superstar Davido were excited about the new partnership; being fully persuaded of the greatness that this power-combination would birth. “The afro-pop star and brand ambassador after the visit took time to take pictures and converse with members of staff before leaving the premises. Asides from the courtesy visit being pleasant, it is also perceived to hold great promises as conversations struck between the brand and its ambassador, and as a result, series of great events are most likely to unfold in the nearest future.”
