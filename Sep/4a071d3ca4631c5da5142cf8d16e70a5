Anthony Joshua has finally admitted he had to ‘grieve’ after losing his heavyweight titles to Andy Ruiz in a shock loss in June. He handed over his WBO, IBF and WBA and IBO belts to the Mexican after defeat in the seventh round having been knocked down four times. The pair will fight once again in Saudi Arabia on December 7, and Joshua insisted the first loss of his career was just a ‘blip’. According to UK’s Daily Mail, Joshua said: ‘I think I had to grieve and ask myself all the questions you would expect. ‘People say ‘you lost’, I call it a blip. ‘I can’t wait to get in there and fight him. Every time I have fought a champion I have risen to the occasion.’ Joshua also revealed he could change his approach in order to be more proactive at the start of fights. ‘I need to start taking this approach to my fights where I’m a bit more lively. ‘I know I’m capable of it. There is too much at stake. ‘If I go in there where I’m switched on, a time like the Ruiz fight where I am so relaxed, that might be the difference.’
