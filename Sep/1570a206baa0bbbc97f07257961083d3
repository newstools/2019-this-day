Obinna Chima The Founder/Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Jim Ovia, has withdrawn from further activities at the ongoing World Economic Forum Africa 2019, taking place in Cape Town, South Africa. A statement from Ovia on Thursday, hinged his decision to pull out of the forum where he was to be one of the speakers, on the, “hypersensitivity of the issues surrounding the lives and well-being of Nigerian citizens living in South Africa and to contribute his voice against the poor state of security regarding foreign nationals living in Africa.” The statement disclosed that before taking his exit, Ovia stressed the need for youth empowerment and better government policies to curb continual attacks on persons living within and outside Africa. He said until positive change towards collective growth happens on this front, the continent would not reach its potential. Ovia, added that full support should be rendered in vocational education of the young persons living in not just Nigeria but Africa. According to him, the Jim Ovia Foundation has taken up a stance on this issue, having empowered over 3,500 students and entrepreneurs since its inception. He called on other members of the private sector to join hands and solve this menace plaguing the African continent.
