Goddy Egene The Nigerian stock failed to sustain the positive performance recorded the previous week as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index fell 0.29 per cent to close at 27,698.69, while market capitalisation ended lower at N13.484 trillion. The depreciation in the NSE ASI came despite an increase of 33 per cent in value of trading, which rose to N18.75 billion   from N14.082 billion the previous week. The market had opened last Monday with a bearish performance, falling by 0.7 per cent. The negative trend was sustained on Tuesday with a depreciation of 0.6 per cent. However, the bulls set in on Wednesday, lifting the market by 1.0 per cent, while the bears returned on Thursday with a decline of 0.1 per cent. Although the market recovered on Friday with a growth of 0.2 per cent, the growth was not enough to off-set the previous losses. Hence, it ended the week with decline of 0.29 per cent. Looking ahead, analysts at Cordros Capital said they expected the market to remain pressured given global risk-off sentiments and weak domestic participation. “Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive while price deterioration has resulted in expected dividend yields on some stocks rising significantly to levels on par with yields on Treasury bills. Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments,” they said. Across Africa, bearish sentiments prevailed  as only  Kenya’s market put up a positive performance.  Kenya’s NSE 20 Index  advanced  0.5 per cent. Egypt’s EGX 30 Index lost the most, down 2.4 per cent, followed by  Morocco’s Casablanca MASI  that went down by 1.1 per cent.

On the positive side, Turkey’s BIST 100 and Thailand’s SET indices appreciated by 2.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent in that order. However, the BRICS market recorded a relatively good performance as three of five markets grew.  India’s BSE Sens index gained 1.7 per cent as the government cut corporate taxes to revive waning growth.
