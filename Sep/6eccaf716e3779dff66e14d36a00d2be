World heavyweight champion Andy Ruiz Jr showed off his knockout power on Instagram yesterday after sharing a video of his latest training session. Ruiz Jr is in camp ahead of his much-anticipated rematch with Anthony Joshua in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 7. The Mexican uploaded a video on Sunday showing him undergoing a pad session with trainer Manny Robles during which he knocks Robles’ pad off his hand. Ruiz Jr stunned Joshua with a seventh round TKO victory and spent the following months enjoying the fruits of his night’s work. His own trainer, Robles, admitted recently that the WBO, WBA, IBF and IBO world champion was in poor physical condition and had done little training before agreeing to a rematch. Ruiz Jr weighed in at 268 lbs (19 stone, 1 pound), prior to his first bout with Joshua but has claimed he will weigh in considerably lighter for their second fight. His target weight of 255 lbs means he could enter the ring in Saudi Arabia over a stone lighter as he bids to be the faster fighter on the night.
