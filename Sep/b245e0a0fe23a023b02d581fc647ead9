The protesters burnt tyres and a billboard around the area, snarling traffic. Commuters were forced to take alternative routes. But FCT Police Spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manza, denied that any attack took place. “Go there and see for yourself. There was no attack on any shoprite mall anywhere in Abuja”, he said.
