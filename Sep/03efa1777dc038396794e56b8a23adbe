Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The federal government has commended the wife of Osun State Governor, Mrs. Kafayat Oyetola, for rescuing a Nigerian man, Benjamin Sesan Ojo, who was stranded in Trinidad and Tobago, describing it as exceptional patriotism. The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, made the commendation in a statement issued yesterday by her Director of Media, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, saying Mrs. Oyetola’s humanitarian gesture was outstanding. She said: “This is an uncommon kind gesture from you. It is a commendable effort and a wonderful humanitarian gesture which must be emulated by other Nigerians.” Dabiri-Erewa noted that the patriotism displayed by the wife of the Osun State governor in bringing back the stranded Nigerian and his six-year-old daughter from Trinidad and Tobago, through her foundation, Ileri Oluwa Development Initiative, was commendable. Ojo, a homeless Nigerian in Trinidad and Tobago, and his daughter, required help to come back home. The Ilesa, Osun State-born citizens had been living in Trinidad and Tobago for 12 years homeless and had been ill for three years without a job or means of coming back home, having lost contact with his family for long. The man, who lost his wife a year ago, could not do anything for himself. In a viral video where he had solicited for help to return to Nigeria, he had said: “I need help to get home; I don’t have work, and I need help to survive till I go back to Nigeria. I am a burden to everybody.” The Osun State first lady reportedly heard about the man through the video and came to his rescue.
