The Chairman of NAHCON, Abdullahi Mukhtar, in a statement signed by the Head, Public Affairs of the Commission, Fatima Sanda Usara, said in total, 43,493 pilgrims were airlifted to Nigeria in 91 trips, since the in bound flights started on August 17 with the airlift of Lagos State pilgrims. Mukhtar seizes the opportunity to congratulate and commend Nigerians and state pilgrims’ welfare board officials for their patience, dedication and support to their respective pilgrims. He prayed that the Almighty continue to guide all pilgrims’ operatives towards success in the discharge of their responsibilities to Nigerians.
