The explained that China slightly de-escalated trade tensions last week as its proposed retaliation to the latest tariffs imposed by the United States  was put on hold. The expectation early in the week was that China would impose tariffs ranging from 5.0 per cent  to 10.0 per cent on $75.0 billion  worth of US goods, with the timeline for implementation matching the two phases – September and December 2019 – established by the US. “As the deadline is only a month away, negotiations have resumed, with China more disposed towards a resolution. Meanwhile, the chance of a ‘no-deal-Brexit’ rose in the United Kingdom  as the Prime Minster got an approval to suspend the parliament till mid-October, paving the way for swift negotiations ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31st October, 2019. While this decision is likely to be tightly contested, the lack of clarity has dampened investor sentiment and the prospects of the UK’s economy post-Brexit,” they said. Consequently, some  developed markets were largely bullish as investors reacted positively to softening trade tensions. In the US, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices gained 3.1 per cent and 3.0 per cent respectively. The France’s CAC, Germany’s XETRA DAX and UK’s FTSE All Share indices also inched higher by 3.0 per cent, 2.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively despite elevated risks of a ‘no-deal-Brexit’ deal. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Japan’s Nikkei 225 indices lost 1.7 per cent and 0.03 per cent respectively.
