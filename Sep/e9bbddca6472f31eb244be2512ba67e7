Hamid Ayodeji Do you understand the daily impact of your influence on the people around you? Are you looking to learn how to develop interpersonal influence when relating with your stakeholders and how to achieve authenticity for sustainable value creation? This excellent programme designed by TEXEM, UK, will help. “When I became a Director 12 years ago, my focus was mainly to deliver a compelling service to my various stakeholders. Two years later, I was tasked to actively engage stakeholders to fulfil my purpose, processes and people needs. This tickled my brains, as I tried to figure out how to act like an impactful leader. I had to figure out how to act as a strategic leader by influencing my peers, subordinates customers, regulators and the board to deliver superior performance,” said a bank CEO in Nigeria. He added that; “What I needed then, was the skills to provide exceptional and effective leadership and positively influence my internal and external stakeholders. This learning opportunity was not easy to come by, but TEXEM was my silver bullet ten years ago. “Like ten years ago, Texem still designs relevant, insightful and beneficial programmes for African executives and organisation to succeed. TEXEM has a fantastic suite of programmes and highly insightful team of faculties. Through their value-adding programmes they increase executive’s knowledge and skills on how to build enduring organisations that aptly addresses their stakeholders’ competing needs”. The operating context of Nigeria is currently characterised by turbulent, ambiguous and complex socio-economic landscape. Thus, visionary leaders in organisations must develop competence in influencing, achieving authenticity and addressing vulnerability for effective and sustainable success. To this end, TEXEM UK expressed its delighted in inviting organisations to join world-renowned Professor Graham Wilson, University of Oxford’s Senior Tutor in Psychology and Counselling. Since 2012, Wilson has developed and led the leadership strand of the GCAP/Smith School (University of Oxford) ‘Adaptation Academy’. During these programmes, Graham helped senior leaders to hone their abilities to influence in highly complex political landscapes. Also, in 2015, Professor Graham Wilson established an Advanced Coaching course for the University of Oxford. His work at Oxford was very successful, and as a result, he is now responsible for devising, supervising, and sharing the delivery of, all coaching programmes – Introductory, Advanced, Group, and Supervision, on an annual basis for the University of Oxford. The two-day programme would hold between October 16th and 17th, 2019, at Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. Programme description
