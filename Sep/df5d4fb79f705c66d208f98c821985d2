By Azuka Ogujiuba It was such a beautiful atmosphere last Sunday, as media mogul, Mo Abudu put together a lavish poolside party to celebrate her best friend, Marian Omatsone, an international business mogul, who turned 55. The private party, which had strictly close friends and families of the celebrant in attendance, was definitely a no expense spared one. From the exotic drinks to the assorted  dishes, the decor, elegant people and great music, it’s safe to say that Abudu went all out for her bestie. Adding spice to the already spicy day, the guests and the celebrant danced their hats out as amazing singer, Omawumi thrilled them with good music. While it was easy to get carried away by all the glitz and glamour, you can’t help but have a fixed sight on Marian and Abudu who were sexily twining in a revealing dress by celebrity fashion designer, Lanre DaSilva.
