It will also be available to purchase online via card or Sheba Miles. Ethiopian said connectivity would be expanded to its other long-haul aircraft in future. Pricing is per megabyte, with 100MB costing $10 or 4,000 miles, and 200MB costing $20 or 8,000 miles. Platinum Sheba Miles members will get 100MB free.
