Peter Uzoho The Managing Director of Neconde Energy Limited, Mr. Frank Edozie, has called for the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence and mobile technology, to guarantee the future of the energy industry. Edozie, made the remark at the 2019 Conference and Exhibition of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Nigeria held recently in Lagos, saying energy industry operators had failed to leverage the potential of data to reinforce the perception that Nigeria is a gas province with a profitable huge opportunity for growth. He said Neconde had been able to surmount its various challenges by adopting innovative business approach, which has positioned the firm to deliver quality services. He added that utilising big available data would change the country’s energy landscape as it would make players in the sector realise the need to liberalise the price of gas, create more value chain opportunities and make fuel subsidy unnecessary. Neconde, is an independent Nigeria oil and gas company serving as a special purpose vehicle for the acquisition and development of petroleum assets. In January 2011, the company participated and emerged successful in the bid for the acquisition of 45 per cent stake in OML 42 previously held by Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited. “Neconde’s status as an indigenous company with an excellent management team offers a viable option through which the currently under developed reserves of the Niger Delta could be brought into production with attendant economic benefits for the country,” he added.
