Justice Adeniyi, while refusing to order that the defendant deposit her international passport with the court because of her health condition, nonetheless held that she should not leave the country without first informing the court.

In count 5 and 6, the defendant was accused of receiving the sum of $10, 000 each on December 18, 2017 and June 27, 2018 from Industrial Consultants International for alleged favour already showed to P&ID in the signing of the contract between the firm and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.
