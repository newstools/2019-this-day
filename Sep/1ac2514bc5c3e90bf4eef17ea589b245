 A review of financial performance of banks quoted on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as at half year of the financial year ending December 31, 2019, indicated there is a tough battle between the top five tier-one banks. Bamidele Famoofo reports Banking was redefined some 29 years ago in Nigeria when some young Nigerian bankers, Mr. Jim Ovia, and the duo of Mr. Fola Adeola and Mr. Tayo Aderinokun, and much recently,  Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede and Herbert Wigwe, took the Nigerian banking industry by storm to create banks today regarded as  ‘new generation banks’.   Zenith, GTBank and Access are indigenous banks that emerged to lock horns with the likes of First Bank, Union Bank and UBA Plc, otherwise referred to as the ‘old generation banks’.    These three banks and others licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the same period have continued to challenge the older banks, giving them a run for their money. Needless to say, the ‘new banks’ now lead among top five tier-one banks in the country both in terms of profitability, assets, deposits and loans and advances, as they continue in their battle for supremacy in the industry. Zenith Bank Plc established by Mr. Jim Ovia, was incorporated in Nigeria under the Companies and Allied Matters Act as a private limited liability company on May 30, 1990. It was granted a banking licence in June 1990, to carry on the business of commercial banking and commenced business on June 16, 1990. The bank was converted into a public limited liability company on May 20, 2004. The bank’s shares were listed on October 21, 2004 on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). In August 2015, the bank was admitted into the Premium Board of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Mr. Fola Adeola and the late Tayo Aderinokun’s Guaranty Trust Bank Plc remains a going concern even after the latter’s demise. The bank now popularly called GTBank Plc, was incorporated as a private limited liability company on July 20, 1990, and obtained a licence to operate as a commercial bank on August 1, 1990. The bank commenced operations on February 11, 1991. It became a public limited company on April 2, 1996, with the listing of its shares on The Nigerian Stock Exchange on September 9, 1996. The bank was issued a universal banking licence by CBN on February 5, 2001. The bank was issued a commercial banking licence with international scope on December 20, 2012, by CBN, following the divestment from all its non-banking subsidiaries in compliance with the CBN Regulation on Scope of Banking Activities and other Ancillary Matters. Access Bank under the watch of Mr. Herbert Wigwe, Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Aigboje Aig- Imoukhuede, immediate past managing director of the bank, has witnessed tremendous growth in the last 18 years or thereabout when they acquired the bank from the former owners.  Access Bank has built its strength and success in corporate banking and is now applying that expertise to the personal and business banking platforms it acquired from Nigeria’s international commercial bank in 2012. The next two years were spent integrating the business, investing in infrastructure and strengthening the product offer.   As part of its continued growth strategy, Access Bank is focused on mainstreaming sustainable business practices into its operations. H1 Financial Review A peer-to-peer review of the audited half year financial performance of some banks whose shares are listed on the NSE for the period ended June 30, 2019, showed that the ‘new generation banks’ are on rampage in their industry.
