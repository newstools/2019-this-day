Our liquidity and capital positions remain robust and well above regulatory limits. Analysts’ assessment
Looking at the results, analysts at WSTC Research, said the decline of 12 per cent was informed by a lower impairment credit write-back for the period and an increase in operating cost. PAT declined by 16 per cent on the back of a higher effective tax rate.
WSTC noted that higher funding cost depressed net interest income. The bank explained that interest income grew mildly by one per cent from N59.92 billion to N60.78bn in H1 2019, on the back of relatively flat growth in interest on loans and investment. Although credit and advances increased by seven per cent from N412.13 billion to N470.9 billion in H1 2019, the lower average yield on loans muted growth in interest income. On the flip side, interest expense rose faster by faster from N19.76 billion to N21.47 billion in H1 2019 despite a 15 per cent decline in customer deposits. Customer deposits decreased from N967.96bn to N822.48 billion due to the liquidation of some ‘expensive’ term and call deposit, which fell by 37 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively,” the analysts said. They added that nonetheless, the spike in interest on borrowed funds by 77 per cent to N6.93 billion, and the increase in interest on savings and current accounts by 33 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, dampened management effort in the funding cost optimisation strategy. “As a result, cost of fund rose by 150bps to five per cent and net interest margin declined by 30bps to per cent. Non-interest income grew by two from N53.83 billion to N54 billion a two decrease in net fees and commission revenue. Net fee and commission revenue declined from N36.69 billion to N35.97 billion due to the impact of regulatory fee reduction on assets under management. However, the 10 per cent growth recorded in both the trading and other revenue informed the growth in non-interest revenue. On the back of lower net impairment reversal on financial instruments of N557 million in H1 2019 compared with N5.51 billion in H1 2018 amid three per cent rise in operating cost from N48.78 billion to N50.07 billion, PBT print lower at N44.65 billion (H1 2018: N50.73 billion) and PAT settled at N36.25 billion (H1 2018: N43.08 billion)for the period,” WSTC added.
