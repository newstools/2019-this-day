Seven overseas-based professionals will join the group before the trip to Abidjan for the first leg. Already, the world football governing body, FIFA, has directed that both legs of the qualifying fixture must be concluded between September 30 and October 8. The Nigeria Football Federation has already picked Sunday, October 6, for the return leg match, slated for the Agege Stadium, Lagos.

Cote d’Ivoire also emerged 3-0 aggregate winners, eliminating Mali from the series to set up a clash with nine-time African champions, Nigeria. Asisat Oshoala, scorer of the lone goal against Algeria in Lagos on 3rd September, heads the list of the overseas-based professionals that also includes defenders Osinachi Ohale and Chidinma Okeke, midfielders Ngozi Okobi-Okeoghene and Chinaza Uchendu, and forwards Francisca Ordega and Rasheedat Ajibade.
