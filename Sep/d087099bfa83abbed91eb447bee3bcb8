Manchester City have assembled the first billion-euro squad, a report by the CIES Football Observatory announced yesterday. City, who have benefitted hugely since the Abu Dhabi group takeover in 2008, spent 1.014bn euros on their current players with Paris St-Germain (913m euros) and Real Madrid (902m euros) in second and third respectively. The Premier League champions’ squad is worth 32 times the value of Norwich’s. Manchester United have the second most expensive English squad (751m euros). CIES, the football statistics research group based in Switzerland, looked at the senior players in each team in all four of Europe’s biggest leagues – Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Bundesliga. Paderborn, promoted to the German top flight in the summer, were found to have the cheapest squad, valued at 4m euros (£3.57m). THE TOP 10 Club / squad value in euros 1. Man City – 1.014 billion 2.
