Laleye Dipo interacts with Alhaji Tinau Mohammed Usman, superintendent of Pension Administration in Niger State on how the administration of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has corrected anomalies in the system    We also agreed on the number that will be taken to the two audit
departments. We started with 200 each for each of the departments.  So
we started by paying those who have not collected anything. Till this moment, anybody whose file has been processed and brought to the Pension Board has been paid. How many pensioners do you have now?
For now we have about 16,000 pensioners, state 8703 Local  Why?
It is obvious that it will continue to increase until when we
get to a period of time when all these files that went out are
returned and again don’t forget that people are retiring on daily
basis, but the Law really created 70% of the liability because of the
large number of people that were moved to the old Pension Scheme.
From that time 2017 to now government has paid close to N10billion on
monthly pension after the review of the Law. Why?    Before it collapses what is the way out?  What is the position of the PFAs in all this?  Some permanent secretaries that retired complained that they have
not been paid their entitlement why is this so?  So you are not owing any permanent secretary?  Pensioners recently occupied Benue State Government house for
days demanding their pension, what advice do you have for your pension
Board colleagues and the governments to stop this?  How do you think you can stop this complain by people going round
that they have not received their Pension?
