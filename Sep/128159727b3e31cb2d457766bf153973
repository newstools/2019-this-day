Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The youth wing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has lamented the lack of representation of the youths in the recently constituted cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. Against this background, the National Youth Leader of APC, Sadiq Abubakar, has said that the APC youths have already petitioned the party and the presidency, while also hoping that the youths would be well represented in the appointments of heads of parastatals and agencies. Abubakar stated this while addressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja at the end of the familiarisation and appreciation meeting with the support groups of the party, which he said helped in winning the 2019 elections. He said that the objective of the meeting was to show appreciation, while also ensuring that policies being made by the federal government protect the youths, while also getting them involved in governance. When asked about the representation of youths in the present cabinet, Abubakar said, “there has been communication between us, the party and the presidency. “The executive has constituted the council, that’s the ministers, we haven’t found much of our own representation there as a party, of the youth wing. But we have communicated. I think something is going to come handy for us. We are expecting appointments for Heads of parastatals and agencies.” The youth leader noted that they were expecting 40 per cent appointments in the present administration.
