From that moment, the Nigerian side took a commanding role in the game, winning every ball and daring to increase the tally. But all that changed within 60 seconds in the 78th minute which was just 12 minutes to regulation time. Oleksandr Zinchenko reduced the tally for the hosts in the 78th minute. The ovation that greeted the goal had hardly died down when Roman Yaremchuk leveled up. The goal was initially disputed on account of hand to ball.
