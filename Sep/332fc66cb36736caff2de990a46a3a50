Super Eagles forward, Samuel Chukwueze and Flying Eagles midfielder Tom Dele-Bashiru have been included in the Golden Boy 40-man shortlist. Back in June, Tuttosport, organisers of the annual award which honours the outstanding player under the age of 21, unveiled the list of 100 best young players in the world. The Nigerian duo is joined in the nominees list by Senegal’s Krepin Diatta and they will battle current winner Juventus’ Matthijs De Ligt, Manchester City’s Phil Foden, Chelsea’s Mason Mount, Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior and others for the prestigious prize. Chukwueze enjoyed a breakthrough season in the 2018-19 campaign when he made his way into Villarreal’s first-team and scored five goals in 26 Laliga games. The 20-year-old is among the 10 La Liga youngsters in the selection while Dele-Bashiru joined five other Premier League-based starlets in the list. The Watford midfielder moved to Vicarage Road this summer after starring in Nigeria’s midfield at the U20 Fifa World Cup in Ukraine where he scored a goal in three games. Alongside their Senegalese counterpart, the duo will be hoping to end Africa’s wait for their first Golden Boy winner since the award started in 2003.
